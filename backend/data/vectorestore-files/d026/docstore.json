Hospitals, working with federal and state governments and other third-party payers, should conduct studies and experiments to determine the feasibility and means of creating separate revenue and cost centers for direct nursing care units within the institution for case-mix costing and revenue setting, and for other fiscal management alternatives.” (Institute of Medicine, 1983, p. 18) T HIS SEMINAL RECOMMENDATION by the Institute of Medicine, now over 3 decades old, identifies a key problem in nursing: How do we put a dollar value on the services and interventions provided by nurses? Nursing care is essentially invisible in national payment policy and typically incorporated into daily room charges. We know very little about the actual costs of nursing care provided to each individual patient. In this article, authors provide an overview of micro-costing methods and its history and propose a new approach to costing nursing care in acute care hospitals. This micro-costing model is based on electronic health record (EHR) data, which identify each nurse caring for each patient by shift or shorter time intervals. This information, combined with detailed measurements of patient acuity, will allow a more precise estimation of the actual care time each nurse spends on a patient. The information can then be converted into the cost of nursing care using the nurse wage and other supplemental costs such as shift differential. In addition, cost data can be aggregated or allocated in different ways depending on different administrative or research goals: by patient, demographic characteristic, length of stay (LOS), hospital unit, or diagnosis-related group (DRG). By leveraging data already collected for other purposes in the EHR, the proposed methodology provides more accurate and transparent cost measurement of nursing care without additional data collection burden to nurses. Historical Approaches to Costing Nursing Care The methods used historically for costing nursing care were influenced by external policy changes and data availability. Authors of a large body of nursing cost studies published in the United States in the 1980s responded to new prospective payment system legislation (Edwardson & Giovannetti, 1987; Sovie, 1988), which required an estimation of the cost of care by DRG.

The first step in accounting for nursing costs was selecting a way to aggregate or allocate overall costs of nursing care. The most frequent units of allocation included day of service, medical diagnosis, nursing workload, and nursing intensity (Edwardson & Giovannetti, 1987). The aggregated costs were then distributed by patient or other units. For instance, total nursing costs on a given acute care unit divided by total number of patients derived an average nursing cost per patient per day metric. In a study by Thompson (1984), relative intensity measures constructed in New Jersey used total nursing costs divided by estimated minutes of nursing care required by A Micro-Costing or ‘Bottom-Up’ Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Nursing costs have traditionally been measured as an average across many patients and many nursing services and interventions, hiding the actual costs of nursing care for each patient. Improved micro-costing methods that measure individual nursing care time and costs for each patient are now possible using data from the electronic health record (EHR). Application of patient-level micro-costing methods, using data from the EHR, can provide both improved costing accuracy as well as additional data for analysis about patients, nurses, nursing skill mix, and cost of nursing care by diagnosis (e.g., DRG), patient demographics, and patient outcomes.

The assumption of this top-down approach is all nurses provide essentially the same care for each patient expressed as an average time for all patients without adjustment for differences in patient need for nursing care or severity of illness. This top-down costing approach hides important and clinically meaningful variation in both patient need for nursing care and actual care provided by each nurse. Internationally, healthcare costing and reimbursement policies have used multiple methods to allocate nursing costs in studies conducted in response to need for resource management. Methods of allocation included severity of illness (Park & Song, 1990); workload (Pratt, Burr, Leelarthaepin, Blizard, & Walsh, 1993); direct nursing time per patient observed plus indirect (Pratt et al., 1993); and per diem charges (Elliott, 1997). Belgium law requires collection of a nursing minimum data set since 1988 (Sermeus, Delesie, Van den Heede, Diya, & Lesaffre, 2008) and hospital budgets have been adjusted for nursing care using fixed cost based on staffing ratios plus variable nursing intensity component (Unruh, Hassmiller, & Reinhard, 2008). Micro-Costing Models In the economic evaluation literature, micro-costing or bottom-up costing, refers to a method of costing in which each component of resource use (e.g., laboratory tests, drugs, nurse time) is estimated and a unit cost is derived for each (Drummond, Sculpher, Claxton, Stoddart, & Torrance, 2015). Although this definition implies micro-costing involves a detailed inventory of resources, in practice the term is often used when efforts are undertaken to measure costs in a more precise and disaggregated manner. In contrast to micro-costing, gross costing (or top-down costing) methods, which measure resources on average and in an aggregate manner (e.g., cost per hospitalization), average cost over many diagnoses, or average cost of staffing over a time period or by DRG (Frick, 2009).

The key distinction between micro-costing and gross costing is one of precision of estimates, both in terms of the quantity of resources consumed and their valuation (Gold, 1996). Another distinction is that topdown costing starts with the allocation or aggregation of costs which are then divided by patient or other units. Patient-level nursing costs cannot be identified. Because micro-costing often refers to a more precise estimation of resources used, there is no single micro-costing methodology. The particular methodology depends on data availability and study purpose. In a methodological summary of micro-costing methods, Frick (2009) identified some of the most common ways data are collected in a micro-costing study: administrative datasets, claims data, forms/time logs, surveys, patient charts, and direct observation. Administrative datasets include systems specially designed to capture resources consumed (Holbrook, Hargrave, & Traverso, 1996; Traverso & Hargrave, 1995), such as nurse-patient assignment data, or accounting systems maintained by hospitals (Azoulay et al., 2007). Claims data may include detailed items billed or aggregated payments, yet they only include items that were billed to a payer and may not have a complete description of resources used or their quantities (Etzioni, Riley, Ramsey, & Brown, 2002). Nursing costs, and costs in general, are just quantities multiplied by their price (e.g., the amount of time a nurse spends with a patient multiplied by his/her wage). Considerable information on nurses’ wage by level of experience and education is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017). For generalizability, the common recommendation in economic evaluations is to use national-level average wages rather than local or institution-specific wages and/or compensation (Neumann, Sanders, Russell, Siegel, & Ganiats, 2016). The major challenge in a more accurate estimation of nursing costs is to precisely measure the time nurses spend taking care of a patient. One common micro-costing tool to estimate clinical time is collecting time logs. Time logs can be collected prospectively or retrospectively through surveys, although recall bias is a concern (Drummond et al., 2015), and","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records_3"}}],["4",{"pageContent":"of a patient. One common micro-costing tool to estimate clinical time is collecting time logs. Time logs can be collected prospectively or retrospectively through surveys, although recall bias is a concern (Drummond et al., 2015), and they can be burdensome for staff. These are common in some economic evaluations because it is often needed to separate actual intervention effort from other research and evaluation components (Haddix, Teutsch, & Corso, 2003). Several methods have been developed to simplify data collection by detailing patient care activities and combining them with time estimates from expert panels or direct observation, sometimes called nursing intensity weights (Knauf, Ballard, Mossman, & Lichtig, 2006). These weights are applied to a particular DRG; however, they do not measure the actual nursing care provided to a patient. A different approach using nursing terminologies from nurse assessment data in the EHR applies a relative value unit (RVU) to estimate time (Dykes, Wantland, Whittenburg, Lipsitz, & Saba, 2013). The advantage of the RVU model is its use of actual data of ongoing nursing care to represent need for nursing care. Another micro-costing method is time-based activity driven (TBAD) costing, which originated in the management literature (Kaplan & Anderson, 2004). When applied to health care, its purpose is to accurately measure the cost of treating patients for a specific medical condition across the full care cycle (Kaplan et al., 2014). TBAD combines two steps: process mapping and activity-based costing. During the process mapping stage, clinical teams identify key events in the care cycle, which may involve clinical and administrative components. In the second step, activity-based costing, a dollar-per-minute capacity cost rate for each resource is estimated for all clinical resources involved in the care cycle. One important component in this method is the estimation of the time spent in each activity identified in the process map, which in TBAD is usually done by managers or is based on surveys of employees or even patients. As an alternative, direct observation can be used, which relates TBAD to time-and-motion studies, in which clinical staff is followed and the time spent in different activities recorded (Costa et al., 2016; Finkler, 48 NURSING ECONOMIC$/January-February 2018/Vol. 36/No.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records_4"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"staff is followed and the time spent in different activities recorded (Costa et al., 2016; Finkler, 48 NURSING ECONOMIC$/January-February 2018/Vol. 36/No. 1 Knickman, Hendrickson, Lipkin, & Thompson, 1993; Hendrich, Chow, Skierczynski, & Lu, 2008; Robinson et al., 2007). With this methodology, substantial effort is used in not only determining different activities, but also in accurately recording the time in each of them. While useful to accurately measure time spent on activities, these methods are not practical to implement on a daily basis. Data Structure and Time Measurement The starting point for creating a micro-costing measurement of nursing care is with measuring the unique time each nurse and other nursing personnel spends with each patient from data from the EHR. This can be established using the nurse-to-patient assignment (e.g., a nurse caring for four patients in a 12-hour shift provides on average 3 hours of care for each patient) (Welton, Zone-Smith, & Bandyopadhyay, 2009). Capturing the assignment in the EHR provides a means to allocate nursing intensity based on staffing patterns. Because patients often have different care needs and as a result nurses may spend more time with any single patient, a nursing acuity tool can be used to allocate nursing care hours to each patient from the assignment based on relative differences in demand for nursing care (Garcia, 2017). In the assignment above, a nurse could expend 6 hours for one patient and 2 hours for each of the other patients; therefore, a nursing acuity tool is used to reallocate time accordingly. With this information in place, a bottom-up or micro-costing approach to measure nursing intensity by patient is straightforward. The actual nursing time provided to each patient is multiplied by either the actual or mean wage as well as other direct-care costs such as shift differential. The contribution of other nursing personnel such as LPN/LVN or nursing assistant can be included in the actual costs of care in the same manner. These are the direct costs of nursing care or the actual time and resources expended for each patient. Other nursing personnel costs are not directly allocable to each patient (e.g., a charge nurse who may not take assignments or clinical nurse specialists who work with nurses providing care). Other nursing costs","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\A Micro-Costing or 'Bottom-Up' Approach to Measuring Nursing Costs Using Data from Electronic Health Records_5"}}],["6",{"pageContent":"care or the actual time and resources expended for each patient. Other nursing personnel costs are not directly allocable to each patient (e.g., a charge nurse who may not take assignments or clinical nurse specialists who work with nurses providing care). Other nursing costs not directly allocable to an individual patient include hours worked but the nurse is involved with in-service education or orientation. These can be viewed as direct costs which benefit the patient but cannot be directly assigned. A third component of nursing costs are those that are not actually worked, but incurred as a benefit such as vacation or sick time, or obligation such as jury duty or military leave. These indirect nursing costs add to the overall cost of nursing care and must be considered and monitored. When all costs are identified and linked to each patient, we can more fully understand both the actual or true costs of nursing care provided to each patient. When linked to each patient and the additional data that can be extracted from the patient record in the EHR such as DRG, LOS, patient demographics, or hospital outcome, we can better understand how nursing care resources are uniquely expended for each patient and what patterns can be identified from the data. For example, do older patients need more nursing care than younger patients for the same DRG? Does a higher skill mix of registered nurses, and the higher cost of that skill mix, produce better clinical outcomes which reduces overall costs of health care? Which patients consume more nursing care than others and can we identify these nursing intensity outliers early in the trajectory of a hospitalization and provide more comprehensive and ultimately less costly care? Conclusion A new method of costing nursing care for the individual patient using data from the EHR to link nurses directly to patients and allocate actual hours and wage data provides a unique patient-level metric of nursing care. This micro-costing or bottom-up approach is a more accurate reflection of the clinical care being provided and allows greater transparency of nursing intensity and costs. Collection of patient-level nursing intensity and cost provides a foundation for further analysis that can identify patterns of nursing care linked with clinical as well as operational outcomes. $ REFERENCES Azoulay, A., Doris, N.M., Filion, K.B., Caron, J., Pilote, L., & Eisenberg, M.J.

One of the most influential is the framework put forth by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which includes the following six aims for the healthcare system.[1] Safe: Avoiding harm to patients from the care that is intended to help them. Effective: Providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and misuse, respectively). Patient-centered: Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. Timely: Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care. Efficient: Avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. Equitable: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status. Existing measures address some domains more extensively than others. The vast majority of measures assess effectiveness and safety. Some capture timeliness and patient-centeredness. Fewer measures focus on efficiency and equity of care, but attention to those domains has been growing.[2] Frameworks like the IOM domains also make it easier for consumers to grasp the meaning and relevance of quality measures. Studies have shown that providing consumers with a framework for understanding quality helps them value a broader range of quality indicators. For example, when consumers are given a brief, understandable explanation of safe, effective, and patient-centered care, they view all three categories as important. Further, when measures are grouped into user-friendly versions of those three IOM domains, consumers can see the meaning of the measures more clearly and understand how they relate to their own concerns about their care.[3] Learn more about Organizing Measures To Reduce Information Overload.

Editor’s note: The following was written by Dan Egli, PhD, executive search consultant, quality services, performance improvement, and risk management, The Roman Healthcare Group, LLC. He can be reached at dane@romanhealth.com. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” For many organizations, accreditation demonstrates a commitment to improve quality, manage risk, and distinguish itself from its competitors. The challenge is choosing an accreditation organization (AO) that fits in with your organizational culture and philosophy. Today more than ever, selecting an AO is a strategic decision which requires research to find the right organizational fit. Sometimes, what was great then, doesn’t always fit now. This is because organizations change as do accreditors. It may not be possible to know why you are accredited by a certain AO, or it may be because that has always been the case. Having a look into other options can be daunting. This brief provides insights to thought provoking questions that aim to facilitate the decision-making process. “I think I could, if I only know how to begin.” Start by considering what is important to your organization, reflect on your philosophy and values, and then make a list of what is important in an accreditation partner. Describe that list with qualitative statements. For example, quality can mean a variety of things; for some, it is the ability to submit measures and have access to quarterly benchmark reports for each indicator. It could also mean the look and feel of the AO from an aesthetic view such as the design of the manual, or style of correspondence. Just as quality is broad, so is the style of the AO’s survey. Are you looking for the army sergeant, school master, mentor, friend, or partner? The five Cs 1. Culture: Does the AO’s mission and vision resonate with your organization? Consider the AO’s culture and philosophy from the desk to the survey.

An AO with a supportive educational focus may have a collegial peer to peer review philosophy; this AO may also provide direct live support for standards interpretation; an AO with an excellence focus may be driven by metrics; or, you may just want an AO who will accredit you and leave you alone for three years. 2. Communication: Communication is an important aspect of partnership. What is important to your organization when it comes to style of communication? Culture is reflected through communication, along with excellence and quality of workmanship. Communication can make you feel empowered, fearful, supported, or disempowered. Check in with yourself every time you have a conversation with the AO: Were you able to connect with someone, were all your questions answered, did you receive the information you required? Did you feel empowered or confused? 3. Cycle: Find out about the number of surveys and the survey-related processes involved with a three-year cycle, because this impacts cost. What is the reporting procedure and what happens if you have conditions out during the survey? 4. Cost: How much does a three-year cycle cost in total? When considering cost, bear in mind operating costs, which include: staff time across all aspects of the survey process, such as quality specialists, life safety specialists, and data specialists. Additional costs, which are not always seen until the agreement has been signed, include quality-related IT applications and data vendors/portals that may be required. Are the standards straightforward, or do you need videos, webinars, and other resources to interpret them? How often do the standards change?

Consultation: Find out if the AO will conduct a business presentation. If you are a smaller organization, a webinar is the most practical and cost effective way of meeting your potential AO. If you are a health system with several hospitals, it is reasonable to request a face-to-face business presentation/meeting with key decision-makers. To acknowledge the questions and make any sort of informed decision, some additional information is essential. The primary AOs for hospital accreditation include: The Center for Improvement in Healthcare Quality (CIHQ), Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP)—which is now a part of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC)—and The Joint Commission. The challenge is there is no one repository for the information you need. Each organization is focused on ensuring the advancement of safe, reliable, quality care. While each AO must survey to the CMS hospital Conditions of Participation, they each have their own style, methodology, and process. These nuances are related to structure, cost, frequency of survey, survey process, standards, and resources available to accredited hospitals. The figure on p. 8 provides an overview of the four AOs with information from their key leaders. Reflecting on the journey Once you have done your due diligence and are in the process of determining whether to make a change, it is important to recognize that it can take anywhere up to 18 months to transition to another AO or even begin the initial process for accreditation. Actions to consider as you make this determination: 1. Get references from the AO and get input from others who have made transitions between one AO and another (and perhaps back again). 2. Identify what part of the current AO cycle you are in, which includes date of next annual fee invoice; date of accreditation re-application request and submission deadline. 3. Conduct a gap analysis; review your compliance against each of the AO standards. 4. Involve key stakeholders and leaders within your organization to determine the capacity for and value of this transition. These actions above will provide useful information for healthcare leaders to use to confirm the value of their current AO or potentially develop a time frame for transition to a new AO.

TJC’s Board of Commissioners is comprised of physicians, nurses, healthcare leaders and professionals, and public representatives. TJC leadership helps influence national healthcare policy, funding priorites, performance measurement, and future legislation alongside other key stakeholders and influencers. Accreditation Requirements CIHQ standards are closely aligned with the Medicare Conditions of Participation at 42CFR. Requirements are based on the interpretive guidance provided to CMS State enforcement agencies in the State Operations Manual (SOM). Because the Conditions of Participation address minimum standards of care, CIHQ has developed additional standards that address key quality and patient safety challenges faced in today’s healthcare environment. CIHQ’ standards are clear, understandable, and designed to allow hospitals maximum flexibility in developing compliance strategies. DNV standards are directly related to the CMS Conditions of Participation (CoPs) and apply to any size hospital. Standards are less prescriptive and the survey process supports CMS quality initiatives, focus on continual improvement prioritized by the organization, and allows organizational innovation to determine the most effective means for compliance using best practices. HFAP standards include CMS and other nationally recognized standards, as well as evidence-based best practice and selected patient safety initiatives. Standards are realistic, understandable, measurable, beneficial, and achievable. The standards exceed the Conditions of Participation (CoPs). Leading healthcare practice standards and National Patient Safety Goals are developed in concert with healthcare professionals, the public, and other key stakeholders. The standards exceed the Conditions of Participation (CoPs) and are directly relevant to the current delivery of healthcare.

CIHQ requires hospitals to only undergo a survey for services and sites of care billed under the hospital’s Medicare CCN. CIHQ does not require entities to be surveyed just because of a relationship with the hospital. The NIAHOSM and ISO surveys are done together through Tracer Methodology, as well as staff and patient interviews. Tracer Methodology has been a staple of ISO 9001 surveys since ISO’s inception in 1987. All areas of the hospital are surveyed, both clinical and non-clinical. Tracer Methodology is a tool to identify and document effective processes. Comprehensive, non-biased and thorough reviews of patient-centered processes within the facility are conducted in the least disruptive way possible. Educationally focused reviews also offer non-prescriptive recommendations for corrective measures for deficiencies found. With guidance from the healthcare field, TJC developed the tracer methodology to follow and evaluate the quality of a patient’s healthcare experience. This offers a patient-centered and process focused survey rather than a paperintensive process.

Comparison of Accreditation Organizations (cont.) Comparison Element Center for Improvement in Healthcare Quality (CIHQ) Det Norske Veritas Healthcare, Inc. (DNV) Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP) The Joint Commission (TJC) Scoring Process All standards and attendant requirements are scored as “pass / fail”. There are no percentages or categories. The closer a standard is to assuring the provision of safe quality care, the higher the expectation of compliance will be. The goal is to strike a proper balance between focusing on meaningful issues versus technical and isolated lapses in compliance. DNV does not aggregate the scoring of the survey. The organization is responsible for developing and implementing corrective action plans to address all noncomformities identified. “Surveyors report discrepancies to the HFAP Office. The facility is then sent a comprehensive report. The facility then submits a Plan of Correction within 30-60 days.” Accreditation Categories (Accredited - Fully meets all CIHQ accreditation policies and requirements) (Accreditation at Risk - Violation of key CIHQ policies / survey requirements) (Accreditation Withdrawn / Denied - There are two reasons why accreditation would be denied 1. Failure to ultimately address an “accreditation at risk” issue 2.

They are: Full Accreditation; Interim Accreditation; and Denial. “TJC has the following categories of accreditation: • Accredited (Hospital is in compliance with all applicable standards at the time of survey or has successfully addressed all requirements for improvement.) • Provisional (Hospital fails to successfully address all requirements for improvement within a specified timeframe.) • Conditional (Nature of the Requirements for Improvement requires an onsite follow-up survey) • Preliminary Denial (Severity of findings justifies denial of accreditation. Decision is subject to review and appeal.) • Denial (Accreditation has been removed or denied and appeals have been exhausted.)” Cost of Accreditation CIHQ Charges a flat annual fee, based on licensed bed capacity. This fee includes full and mid-cycle surveys as well as travel expenses. In addition, there is NO additional fee for follow-up and complaint surveys (two per year). Hospitals pay only travel expenses. CIHQ has a low price guarantee and will meet or beat the overall cost of other accrediting organizations DNV does not charge for the NIAHOSM Standards, Interpretive Guidelines or Accredidation Process for non-commercial use The cost of the survey is based on the number of surveyors and the length of the survey. Size of the facility, average daily census, number of FTEs, complexity of services offered, type of survey to be conducted and whether special care units or off-site clinics or locations will factor into the cost of the survey. A “Quick Quote” can be submitted to the DNB via the Web site. The average annual cost for DNV services is $23,100. These fees include all travel expenses. “The average cost for HFAP services averages $25,000 for three years. Individual facility costs vary by size and complexity.” The average cost for TJC services is $33,000 for three (3) years; a survey is required once every three years.

Public Health Care Advocacy CIHQ works closely with CMS and other key stakeholders in shaping the accreditation and regulatory environment for hospitals in the United States. BLANK While HFAP participates in a variety of federal, state, and local support initiatives to advance patient quality and safety, its primary focus is delivering a high quality, educationally focused survey experience. TJC has been the American healthcare quality advocate for more than half a century with ongoing initiatives such as “Speak Up,” National Patient Safety Goals, Office of Quality Monitoring, Quality Check, Public Advisory Group, Business Advisory Group, Board representation, and public policy initiatives to help consumers and providers of healthcare. Patient Safety CIHQ has embedded strong principles of patient safety into its standards, and use evidence-based best practices in helping hospitals identify potential risks to patient safety and subsequently develop risk mitigation strategies. “DNV supports the initiatives that hospitals have developed and implemented to guide safe patient care practices. DNV also supports and fosters innovations through development of hospital best practices but clearly understand that some practices do not suit all organizations. DNV believes that there are different avenues for achieving positive patient safety outcomes and the hospitals know their patient populations and resources best.” HFAP incorporates safety standards from a variety of sources to reflect the broad national spectrum. Using the Medicare CoPs as a base and adapting such things as the NQF 30 safe practices and endorsing the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s “5 Million Lives Campaign” HFAP accreditation standards include current patient safety initiatives throughout. TJC has a proven record of helping thousands of organizations address their patient safety problems, including the review of sentinel events. Collective learning from their experience has been shared with the broader healthcare community of organizations, such as through the publication of Sentinel Event Alerts. Goals of Organization CIHQ’ goal and mission is to create a regulatory environment that enables healthcare organizations to effectively deliver safe, quality patient care.

DNV has two major goals: to access compliance and educate hospitals in best practices. Hospitals can use innovation to develop new methods for producing positive results. DNV holds hospitals accountable to ensure that processes are planned, managed, measured, documented, and continually improved. The HFAP goal is to continue to help healthcare facilities deliver high quality patient care through the application of its consistent standards while continuing to streamline and improve its survey processes. The goal is to help hospitals become “high reliability” organizations for delivering safe, effective care. TJC helps hospitals help patients to achieve continual progress toward quality healthcare. Continuous Improvement CIHQ believes that hospitals are in the best position to determine for themselves an approach to continuous improvement. CIHQ does not prescribe a specific performance improvement methodology as a condition of accreditation, or dictate to the leadership of a hospital or medical staff how it will govern itself. DNV utilizes integrated standards from the internationally recognized ISO 9001 quality management system requirements. For more than 60 years, the HFAP has provided healthcare facilities with a reliable system of measurement for improving their processes enabling them to provide their communities with high quality patient care. They continue to evaluate their program to support the ever evolving healthcare environment. The heart of TJC’s “Gold Seal of Approval”™ centers on continuous improvement with employee involvement, enablement, and empowerment. For 50 years, TJC has been working together with healthcare providers on innovative solutions and new processes, such as the Standards Improvement Initiative and the Health Care-Associated Infection Compendium.

This play on words introduces a set of data tied to, well, time. Consider the many things nurses do: take a set of vital signs at 8:00 a.m., give a medication at 9:00 a.m., or get a patient ready for a procedure at noon. We count things that happen between two time points such as the assignment of nurses to a number of patients in a 12-hour shift. Time and date stamps form an essential part of our data architecture in the electronic health record (EHR). Data that are clinically relevant have a unique patient identifier. This links EHR data to someone under the care of nurses and other healthcare providers. Nursing-collected data also have a unique nurse identifier attached (e.g., the nurse who recorded a set of vital signs or administered a medication). Linking nurses to patients allows for evaluation of care provided by individual and groups of nurses over time. This set of data forms the basis for many if not most clinically and operationally relevant analysis to identify events, compare two or more data points, monitor the sequence of events, count the number of events between time points, or identify the variability and trajectory of events over time (see Table 1). Comparing Data Over Time A time-referenced state variable shows the value of a clinically meaningful event such as a blood pressure or serum blood sugar for a patient at a particular time and date against some expected or normal value. A comparison can be made between events (e.g., a heart rate of 120 at 0900 is higher than a heart rate of 86 at 0600). Time-referenced sequence data compares data points over time. For example, an intravenous antibiotic scheduled every 12 hours can vary by actual administration by 1-2 hours or more and potentially affect effectiveness or toxicity of a drug. The number of events within two time points can be calculated (e.g., how often nurses manage patient pain through serial assessments). If the unit practice requires assessments every 4 hours and reassessment after a PRN analgesic is given, the number and variance of these assessments can be calculated. With patient and nurse unique identifiers, several new analyses are possible. Patient-level data can be used to analyze how often pain was assessed by each nurse","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Data, Science, & Nursing Value.

With patient and nurse unique identifiers, several new analyses are possible. Patient-level data can be used to analyze how often pain was assessed by each nurse and associated with patient satisfaction scores. The types of nurses can be evaluated (e.g., how well do inexperienced or float nurses perform compared to other nurses?). This raises the question of “big brother” watching (Welton, 2016). However, using timereferenced data linked to nurses and patients can provide a useful and powerful tool to identify patterns and trends that are clinically and operationally relevant and may provide actionable information that can optimize nursing care delivery systems. One other interesting aspect of using time-referenced data is the link between events and a patient’s clinical course (see Table 2). One example is the relationship between monitoring a patient’s blood glucose level and insulin administration. If blood sampling is delayed, there could be a higher incidence of hyperglycemia. Several key clinical or operational indicators could be combined to take a snapshot of a unit. Examples include the number of patients with elevated body temperature, overall delays in medication administration, how often patients are ambulated after surgery, etc., as potential indicators of high nursing workload and missed nursing care (Kalisch & Xie, 2014). Time-Referenced Data EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A time-referenced state variable shows the value of a clinically meaningful event for a patient at a particular time and date against some expected or normal value. Time-referenced data can provide new insights into patterns, trends, and clusters of events directly from the data collected and used by nurses in providing health care. The direct link between nurses and patients using unique identifiers for both can provide clinically and operationally meaningful information and details over different time horizons. JOHN M.

The link established between nurses collecting data and an individual patient provides a basis for examining a nursing encounter or the interaction between one or more nurses and patients over time. Aggregate data sampled over different time frames can provide a way to identify changes in unit or hospital performance. Altogether, time-referenced data can provide new insights into patterns, trends, and clusters of events directly from the data collected and used by nurses in providing health care. The direct link between nurses and patients using unique identifiers for both can provide clinically and operationally meaningful information and details over different time horizons than has been possible to date. $ REFERENCES Kalisch, B.J., & Xie, B.

Oster, PhD, MBA, APRN, ACNS-BC, CNS-BC, ANP, FAAN Malcolm Gladwell (2002), in his book The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, describes how an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a certain point and then begins to spread like wildfire. It is often not one big idea or action that causes the change but a series of small events. Changes in thinking that succeed are driven by exceptional people who message an idea that is impossible to ignore. A precursor to Gladwell’s thinking is the philosophy of Thomas Kuhn (1962) about how thinking in science changes. Kuhn famously described a paradigm shift as a change in thinking about normal science. His theory is that science experiences a paradigm shift when relevant scientific questions are not able to be answered with the prevailing view. High reliability thinking is a tipping point and is part of a paradigm shift in science and a social shift in thinking as described by Gladwell. High reliability thinking is on the Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push—in just the right place—it can be tipped. –Malcolm Gladwell “ ” Copyright 2021. Sigma. All rights reserved.

A key factor in crossing the tipping point is the “stickiness” of the message or the factors that make the message impossible to ignore and easy to spread (Heath & Heath, 2007). To message high reliability in a way that it will take hold, we need to make the message straightforward and impactful. The purpose of this chapter is to shape a message that can be taken to promote and spread high reliability thinking. This chapter will discuss internal and external challenges facing healthcare, explain why a highly reliable model is needed to address these challenges, and end with examples of success in organizations that have crossed the tipping point to achieve the paradigm shift. Background In the United States, the healthcare industry has shifted from a mostly provider-controlled culture to consumer-driven and value-based models. This has revealed the need to raise the bar on both quality and patient safety—in other words, on reliability. In healthcare, reliability means delivering failure-free health-related processes, procedures, or services in the required time. In this context, failure can result from not applying the appropriate evidence-based practices, failing to respond in a timely manner, or failing to practice patientcenteredness by including patient preference (Nolan, Resar, Haraden, & Griffin, 2004). Because of the complex, fragmented, and imbalanced healthcare system in the United States, the nation’s healthcare industry is struggling with how to respond to the growing demands of the government, private payers, and consumers. Each of these parties needs to see the value of each dollar that is spent. In addition, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014), health insurance exchanges now give patients the option to shop for and compare health plans. This has made patients more conscious and aware of the service and quality of care they receive. As a result of these shifts, demands on the healthcare system to improve value, accessibility, efficiency, cost, service, and quality are growing. These issues are causing tremendous strain, stress, and safety risks among healthcare organizations and systems. There is pressure on all fronts for organizations to identify sustainable strategies to meet the needs of consumers and create a more reliable healthcare system. The challenges are ever present. The tipping point is here. Clearly, a paradigm shift in healthcare is in order.

Twenty some years have passed since the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report To Err Is Human (1999), which sparked the nation to reflect on the state of the healthcare delivery system. It called for action to change how healthcare was being delivered. Although many healthcare systems and hospitals have made tremendous changes that have resulted in improved quality of care and patient safety, as a whole, the healthcare system and hospitals continue to experience unstirring results in preventable harm adverse events (Chassin, 2019). Mark Chassin, one of the authors of the 1999 report, reflected on the impact of To Err Is Human and stated that we have made progress in singular projects adapting a “one size fits all” best practice, which is difficult to spread and to sustain. He suggests that to continue to move the needle on safety and quality, we need to: ■ Focus on zero harm ■ Commit to overhauling the organizational culture to allow safe reporting of safety issues ■ Utilize effective process improvement methods incorporating lean, Six Sigma, and change management (Chassin, 2019) Undoubtedly, more work is needed to elevate patient safety to the top of the list of strategic EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 10:09 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

External Drivers Cost, Cost, and Cost The US healthcare system is in a state of flux. Many forces play a role in how the healthcare system is viewed as a whole. In addition, there is growing pressure to approach the delivery of healthcare differently. There is no doubt that the gap between the actual cost of care and reimbursement is increasing.

The cost of healthcare is growing at an alarming rate, and access to care continues to be a challenge for many. The US is viewed by many countries as a leading nation in the world—except in its fundamental approach to providing healthcare to its citizens. In the US, healthcare is one of many goods in a free-market economy that citizens are expected to provide for themselves (with the exception of emergency services and Medicare benefits for inpatient, hospice, and home health services) (Barton, 2009). Many barriers affect citizens’ access to health services and have a direct impact on healthcare expenditures and health outcomes. The US consumes a higher percentage of its gross domestic product for healthcare— 17.8%—than any other developed country (Papanicolas, Woskie, & Jha, 2018). According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (2020), the per-capita total expenditure for healthcare by US citizens in 2017 was $10,209. In comparison, in Canada, which is similar in size and on the same continent, citizens spend $4,826 per capita. The cost of healthcare in the US has not only strained the federal government, but affected state governments and the private sector as well. Health spending estimates for 2018 through 2027 project that healthcare spending will increase at an average rate of 2.5% per year up to 2027. This is the fastest growth in over a decade (CMS, 2019b). The increased coverage of the ACA may contribute to increased usage of physicians and outpatient services and higher spending in hospitals. Along with the overutilization of diagnostic tests and procedures, healthcare providers experience challenges in encouraging consumers to become active participants in their health. Other factors affect healthcare spending, too. The growth of the elderly population, prescription drug charges, and the rising cost of caring for a segment of the population suffering from chronic diseases make up a large portion of healthcare spending. Prescription drugs represent approximately 11% of the overall US healthcare expenditure—a number that is expected to climb due to the expansion of healthcare coverage (Schumock et al., 2014). Lastly, the failure to manage chronic diseases has become a crisis in the US and is draining the healthcare system.

A highly reliable healthcare environment is unique in that it embraces the use of standardized processes and procedures to provide efficient and effective care. A Push for Performance Because of the enormous dollars spent on healthcare, and because quality outcomes are below the standards expected in a developed country, health insurance payers have begun to question the value their beneficiaries are receiving. Healthcare organizations are experiencing a shift away from fee-for-service to value-based payment models. Payment models such as pay-for-performance and at-risk models have become more common. An example of a pay-for-performance program is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Value-Based Purchasing program (CMS, 2015b). This approach moves away from incentivizing solely for quantity and moves toward accountability for quality, efficiency, and cost management. Pay-for-performance models have defined measures and require data collection and public reporting. In an at-risk model, base payment is predicated on the estimated expected cost of care to treat a condition or patient population. Success is based on the ability to manage cost control and expenditures. These new payment models are a step toward improving quality and services, but they do not come without challenges. One challenge is agreeing on how to define and measure quality in healthcare. How value is defined by CMS and other regulatory agencies does not always align with the definition used by physicians, healthcare organizations, and consumers. CMS and commercial payers view value-based payment as a solution to growing healthcare costs. However, there are conflicting views on what quality measures to use to achieve value and lower cost.

CMS and commercial payers view value-based payment as a solution to growing healthcare costs. However, there are conflicting views on what quality measures to use to achieve value and lower cost. Some private insurers follow the CMS lead, whereas others have developed their own measures (Birk, 2015). This misalignment has contributed to uncertainty and unpredictability in the healthcare delivery system, where the overwhelming cry from providers, payers, and consumers is for standardization, transparency, and consistency. Another key driver that is shifting the culture of healthcare is consumers’ growing demand that the healthcare delivery system demonstrate value. More and more, consumers are evaluating the healthcare services they receive. They’re accessing public reporting quality measures to choose their health plans and healthcare facilities. In 2012, Keckly and Coughlin published their longitudinal study of consumers’ perceptions of the healthcare delivery system between 2008 and 2012. The study revealed that the healthcare system’s overall performance has increased. However, the system was seen as confusing, complex, costly, and wasteful. There was little confidence that the healthcare industry was prepared to deal with future care expenses. Consumers did have confidence in their primary care physicians, but not in hospitals or their health plans. The current state of healthcare has made little progress since 2012. Healthcare spending remains out of control, and the industry has made only small incremental gains on the quality front. To summarize, one driver that is shifting the healthcare culture paradigm is the focus on healthcare quality. More and more, quality performance and expectations have moved to center stage. Public reporting of healthcare systems’ and hospitals’ quality performance is used by insurance payers, financial institutions, and consumers to make decisions about their healthcare and investment. Unfortunately, the added spotlight on quality performance has not reduced incidences of patient harm or deaths due to preventable harm events in healthcare systems and hospitals.

In the past decade, progress has been made in both affordability and accessibility to healthcare. In March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), colloquially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA). On March 30, 2010, PPACA became law after it was amended by the Healthcare and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). On June 28, 2012, two years after PPACA became law, the US Supreme Court upheld the ACA. A key part of the ACA was an individual mandate to obtain health insurance or to pay a penalty (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). Since the passage of PPACA, there has been an increase of 11 million US citizens with healthcare coverage (Congressional Budget Office, 2015). Although there have been attempts to repeal the ACA, in 2020, the ACA is still alive but softened a bit with lesser demands on individuals and employers. In addition to expanding healthcare insurance coverage, healthcare reform shifted the landscape and paradigm of healthcare from volume to value. This shift has placed pressure on providers—healthcare systems and hospitals, delivery systems, and administrators—to demonstrate quality and service (Wagner, 2014). For healthcare systems and hospitals to be successful in this new environment, they must take a different approach to quality and service. Value-Based Purchasing The financial structure of the US healthcare system is far from universal. The government funds significant areas in healthcare to support the public health programs known as Medicare and Medicaid. The remainder of insurance purchasers are employers and private payers (CMS, 2011). Given the rising cost of care, the government and private purchasers of healthcare have become more involved in the process of paying for healthcare. These purchasing groups have begun to monitor and measure how their dollars are spent. They also have come to expect improved quality and better clinical outcomes and service. This is collectively known as value-based purchasing (VBP), which is a purchasing practice that aims to increase the value of a dollar spent on improving quality and managing expenditures (CMS, 2019a). In 2010, the VBP program was established as part of the ACA.

In 2010, the VBP program was established as part of the ACA.

It aims to enhance the quality of care and health outcomes and to improve the experience of care and value to its Medicare beneficiaries across various care settings (CMS, 2019). Not only are participating hospitals paid for quantity of service, but inpatient service is paid based on quality of service. The VBP program for 2020 “requires that 2 percent of the payments for all participating hospitals be withheld and redistributed to the hospitals based on their performance on a previously announced set of quality and cost measures. We estimate that the total amount available for value-based incentive payments in FY 2020 will be approximately $1.9 billion” (CMS, 2019a, p. 1). Distribution of funds is based on a Total Performance Score, which is made up of four quality performance measures: ■ Clinical Outcomes ■ Safety ■ Person and Community Engagement ■ Efficiency and Cost Reduction (CMS, 2019a) CMS estimates that the “best performing hospital will receive a net increase of 2.93 percent EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 10:09 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

Research demonstrates that health organizations using comprehensive process improvement tools improve quality of care (Chassin, 2015; DuPree et al., 2009). Healthcare Regulation Healthcare systems and hospitals are regulated by a broad range of regulatory bodies and programs from local, state, federal, and private organizations. All these agencies and programs set their own standards and measures. This can pose problems and sow confusion for those who provide care. Moreover, in some cases, the level of authority is not clearly defined. In addition to the federal regulatory bodies that provide oversight for healthcare systems and hospitals, physicians, and insurance companies are the coordinating bodies for the local and state agencies. On the private-sector side are organizations such as the American Medical Association and the Board of Nursing, which provide oversight of medical and nursing professionals, respectively. Supplemental government standards also exist, where the hospital industry can choose to supplement the state license through The Joint Commission (TJC) (Field, 2008). Despite these oversight challenges, the healthcare community, the private sector, and consumers would agree that regulatory agencies are essential to balancing the power of one agency over another. Also, these regulatory agencies aid in advocating for the safety of patients and employees in healthcare facilities and in holding providers, healthcare systems, and hospitals accountable for health outcomes. Founded in 1951, TJC is a leading not-for-profit organization that has certified more than 20,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the US (2015a). TJC’s mission is to “continuously improve healthcare for the public, in collaboration with other stakeholders, by evaluating healthcare organizations and inspiring them to excel in providing safe and effective care of the highest quality and value” (2015). For hospitals to achieve accreditation from TJC, they must consistently meet many standards. Recently, TJC has added to these standards the accountability of hospital leadership to assess the hospital’s culture of safety. Collectively, only a relatively small percentage of health systems and hospitals across the country achieve top-quality honors from TJC.

TJC has developed a forum for best practices through the creation of TJC Center for Transforming Healthcare (Birk, 2015). The HRO approach can help healthcare organizations design systems to aid in identifying unsafe conditions well before they lead to harm (Chassin, 2015). This is different from the current healthcare environment, which is more reactive to mistakes. Also, HROs recognize that all errors cannot be prevented and that safety can be derailed. And, there is a willingness to grant the team or individual with the greatest expertise the decision-making authority to address the safety risk. Social Determinants of Health Healthcare, social, and regulatory agencies are looking deeper into the reason for the rising spending in healthcare and are taking a preventative stance to look further upstream at what leads to unhealthy conditions. Improvements in health and well-being seldom begin at the hospital level but occur long before a person engages with the system. Thus, there is a focus on prevention and social determinants of health.

According to the WHO (n.d.), SDOH include: ■ Socioeconomic factors ■ Access to healthy food ■ Neighborhood conditions ■ Social support ■ Access to employment and training ■ Access to available healthcare providers Models are emerging to encourage healthcare organizations to engage with the community to assess and assist in providing care that addresses factors outside of the hospital. For example, not-for-profit hospitals are required to perform a community health needs assessment to gain input from the community on their needs, to know the number of healthcare providers in the community, and to assess community access to meet their needs. Medicaid is supporting programs that require hospitals to assess and mitigate SDOH to assist their clientele (Manatt, Phelps, & Phillips LLP, 2019). Furthermore, many organizations are integrating assessment of social determinants into their intake assessments. Positive assessments can then be directed to resources. It is now not enough to only provide care in hospitals and healthcare clinics. The importance of addressing the determinants of health are our global priority as well. Our community has history and stories that contribute to their health and welfare that cannot be ignored. Care of patients cannot be limited to just one hospitalization. To reliably improve the health of those in our communities, we need to engage with the community.

In addition to these challenges, the tests of local disasters and emerging illnesses causing rapid change in patient volume and type are often looming on the horizon. Healthcare agencies must be resilient to these challenges. Resilience in this context is defined as the system capacity to “absorb, adapt and transform when exposed to a shock . . . and still retain the same control over its structure and functions” (Blanchet et al, 2017). Furthermore, Erik Hollnagel (2016) defines a resilient system as one that can adapt and adjust functioning prior to, during, or following events and thereby sustain required operations under both expected and unexpected conditions. A system is resilient if it can adapt, respond, and recover from events that are out of the ordinary. Shocks to the healthcare system are occurring more often and require organizations to have a level of mindfulness and readiness to act that has not been required before. The resilience required of the healthcare systems following the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017 is difficult for any organization to plan. During the aftermath of mass shootings, hospitals are now training on how to care for mass casualties in the emergency department, quickly coordinating to obtain needed providers, rapid triage, and techniques to stop the bleeding (Castenada, 2018). Consider the Ebola crisis in 2014/2015, which highlighted how poorly prepared our systems are to crisis (United Nations Highlevel Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises, 2016). An outcome of this event was starting the conversation on organizational and global resilience in the face of an epidemic. The focus on how health systems can cope with crisis has become a focal point, as crisis seems to be occurring more frequently. A key principle to high reliability is resilience. Within resilience is the knowledge that not everything is knowable and not everything can be expected. Reliable systems realize that they cannot anticipate every situation that might come through the door; however, they spend their time increasing their capability to respond by practicing how to do a quick study, communicate, collaborate, and act (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2015).

Internal Drivers Complexity of the Healthcare System Depending on the field of study, complexity has various meanings. In healthcare systems, complexity is defined as the interrelatedness of components of a system. Complexity increases with the number of components, the number of relationships between them, and the uniqueness of these relationships (Kannampallil et al., 2011). For instance, consider the difference in complexity between a community hospital and the Mayo Clinic health system. The Mayo Clinic has more components than a community hospital; therefore, it is more complex. Complex systems create cognitive and physical challenges for internal and external individuals who interact with the system. Individuals internal to the system expend substantial cognitive effort in performing tasks or creating shortcuts. External users of the system are challenged with interacting with the system, and significant aspects of the system may be ignored (Kannampallil et al., 2011). The current healthcare system has many components: hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation units, patient homes, patients, and families. These components add complexity for users and produce unintended consequences, such as adverse drug reactions, hospitalacquired infections, readmissions, and functional declines (Lipsitz, 2012).

Regulatory agencies are another layer of complexity that causes uncertainty and unpredictability for providers, caregivers, and healthcare leaders. With the conflicting views on quality and outcome measures, healthcare systems and hospitals are at risk of becoming complacent. The opposite can occur in hospitals that ignore warning signs to meet VBP and pay-for-performance measures (Lipsitz, 2012). According to Lipsitz (2012), in complex systems, individual, self-organized behaviors naturally occur, such as the flocking of birds or the schooling of fishes. This creates silos. The key to success is driving collective outcomes that are greater than the sum of their parts. However, this is difficult in the current health system due to silos and the lack of care coordination. Also, the fee-for-service payment model does not support this partnership. The 2013 IOM report “Best Care at Lower Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America” states that to achieve a high level of quality of care at a lower cost, there must be commitment across the system to learn from each other. Coping With Complexity: Advances in Safety Science A main issue with our attempts to harness complexity is our continued focus on the traditional view of safety. The current view of safety has focused our lens on avoiding things that go wrong. We are investigating accidents and adverse events but fail to use a powerful force that is right in front of us. That power is the adaptive nature of human beings to turn course and avert error. Studying what went wrong focuses on a very narrow field of view. Studying how we make things go right opens up our horizon and possibilities for safety. Erik Hollnagel (2014) discusses that when we define safety or being safe, we are defining it as things will go right or the way we expect. He states, “strangely enough, this is not how we assess or measure safety. We do not count the tasks where people succeed and the instances when things work” (p. 99). He states that the current way forward in safety science is not to place the focus on what goes wrong but to focus on ensuring that things go right.

Hollnagel and colleagues (2015) describe Safety I as the basic understanding of safety that starts when something goes wrong. When work goes as planned, there are positive outcomes; when there is a missed step or malfunction or deviation from the plan, there are negative outcomes. Negative outcomes do not occur that often but get a lot of attention and investigation to find a cause and a mitigation factor. On the other hand, positive outcomes occur most frequently but do not get the attention or study that might help us understand and harness the power of how to make things go right. Safety is judged by the system, regulators, and the general public as the rate of errors. As discussed, regulatory agencies, payers, and the public view health facility reports—based on the rate of hospital-acquired infections, falls with injury, hospital-acquired pressure ulcers, readmissions, and surgical site infections—and decide on the “safety” of the hospital. Although this is how we have built the transparency system and this is how we define safety, it does lead us to rely on those numbers to tell our story of safety, when the real safety story may be on the other side. Safety II—What Went Right? Hollnagel and colleagues (2015) describe the premise of Safety II as the fact that focusing on what not to do does not help us in deciding what we should be doing.

Therefore, Safety II focuses on looking at the many times that things go right and to study and add tactics to fortify those efforts. When looking at a failure, it is more productive to understand how the process usually goes well rather than focusing on the one reason it did not. Resilience in this lens is the everyday adjustments that human beings make to avoid failures. The basic view of safety in this paradigm is understanding performance variability. Sensitivity to operations means paying attention to the reality of how work gets completed at the front line, paying attention to procedures and policies that do not work in the context and how those doing the work adapt to be successful (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2015). Therefore, a highly reliable system can benefit from learning how things go right most of the time as well as studying how things go wrong. Zero Harm Commitment The goal to achieve zero preventable harm to patients in the healthcare system is widespread. An internet search of the phrase produces massive amounts of hospitals and healthcare organizations that have made this lofty commitment. A healthcare organization would be remiss in acknowledging that it has a goal of anything less than zero harm. TJC lists the steps that we must take to achieve zero harm: ■ Ensure leadership is committed to zero harm ■ Ensure a culture of safety ■ Incorporate process improvement methodologies into daily work ■ Demonstrate how everyone is committed to safety and quality (TJC, 2020) However, there is an emerging field of thought that although zero harm is our goal, we could get sidetracked into counting numbers to meet the goal and reflecting on the negatives, rather than actually changing the context of the healthcare environment to cause less harm (Dekker, 2018). Part of achieving zero harm is recognizing all the preventable harm that can occur and not just focus on the obvious cases of harm or the preset metrics set by outside agencies. Harm can be physical or psychological. Achieving zero harm means focusing on the right metrics and assuring that harm is detectable.

All use subject to https://www.ebsco.com/terms-of-use 1 THE NEED FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND SAFETY THINKING 13 Current Healthcare Culture Designing and sustaining a safety culture, which is required in order to improve reliability, is inherently difficult in healthcare due to complexity. It is often difficult to visualize what is meant by safety. Patients add another level of complexity with regard to safety because human diseases are different from person to person. The design of the healthcare delivery process in itself creates safety risks and barriers, for which staff must implement workarounds (Khatri, Brown, & Hicks, 2009). Understanding the culture of healthcare and the various branches that add to the complexity can assist with developing solutions to address these challenges. Many agree that the lack of a culture of safety in a healthcare organization could be a key contributor to organizational accidents. An organization’s culture can be viewed as what is valued, its beliefs, and the norms that determine how members interact and act toward patient care and safety. Dynamics of a safety culture can have a direct impact on how issues are detected, corrected, and understood. Therefore, organizations have begun to adopt mindfulness in their safety culture programs. The idea is that a higher level of mindfulness and individuals being more aware of their surroundings and actions can lead to fewer errors and incidents (Sutcliffe, 2011). Building a culture of safety is essential in an HRO environment. Building a culture of safety requires the promotion of trust, reporting, and improvement. HROs balance learning and accountability through the implementation of a Just Culture, where discipline is equably applied across the system. There is a high sense of accountability with regard to adherence to safety measures and processes. Staff are expected to speak up when there is an error or problem. To learn from communication, there is a system to support ongoing feedback (Chassin, 2015). Reactivity Versus Proactivity The approach an organization takes for managing risk and preventing potential harm to patients depends on the organization’s approach to identifying and responding to patient safety issues. The approach used to manage and minimize risk varies from one healthcare system to another. More often than not, this approach is reactive rather than proactive.

However, healthcare systems and hospitals should work to support a proactive approach to increasing patient safety and decreasing risk and exposure to liability. This is key to improving reliability. When it comes to patient safety, what is the difference between being reactive and being proactive? A proactive approach involves an intentional effort to identify risks before events occur and to correct issues before they arise. A leader in a proactive organization takes ownership of identifying risks and causes of incidents instead of blaming circumstances, conditions, or conditioning. Such a leader’s behavior is the result of a conscious choice based on values, not feelings (Covey, 1989). This approach in preventing injury and loss allows for the ability to educate staff and the organization as a whole. In contrast, a reactive approach involves reviewing an event after it occurs for potential causes and process errors. With this approach, the patient could experience poor health outcomes as a result of the incident. This could lead to a legal claim (Stewart, 2011). A leader in this type of environment would more likely blame the event on circumstances or patient condition (Covey, 1989). Suppose an elderly patient received a severe second-degree burn from a heating pad, which was used to treat back pain. In a reactive organization, the patient would receive treatment for the burn—possibly even a skin graft—and would face a long recovery. In a proactive organization, however, the staff would have been educated on the appropriate steps to take EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 10:09 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

Once the program is in place, the organization’s learning capabilities and collaborative nature help to increase patient safety and decrease organizational exposure to liability (Stewart, 2011). Blame/No Blame to Accountability In managing risk, it’s important for an organization to have an understanding or philosophy of how providers, caregivers, and leaders are held accountable for their actions.

It is human nature to demand answers for why an adverse event happens. There is often a strong need to blame someone for an error and hold that person accountable. With this approach, there is an assumption that the person chose to make the error instead of adopting a wrong procedure or process that was on hand at the time of the event. In 1999, Charles Perrow suggested that 60 to 80% of operating errors were in part a result of system errors or failures. In other words, the system—rather than a person—was at least in part to blame for the error. But most company leaders have found that a blaming culture does not foster an environment that brings safety issues to the surface. Organizations that pride themselves on creating a culture of safety routinely examine all aspects of the system after an adverse event. Applying a system approach to investigating an error or adverse event ensures there is no blame. In healthcare that involves human activity and a reliance on technology, it is likely there could be a situation in which individuals experience a problematic interaction or conflict or incorrectly interpret the actions or words of another. It is also likely they will experience problems when interacting with technology. HROs have transitioned from a culture of blame, in which an individual or group is seen as the reason for an error, to one that accepts that no organization is free from error and understands that identifying the cause of an error can both offer operational lessons and enhance organizational learning (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001; Provera, Montefusco, & Canato, 2010). Blaming an individual or group can seriously hinder an organization’s ability to learn from the experience. In a blaming environment, individuals who make errors usually are not willing to share this information with their colleagues or managers. Instead, they try to fix it themselves or cover it up. The no-blame approach can be an effective way of enhancing an organization’s ability to learn. Weick and Sutcliffe (2007) and Khatri, Brown, and Hicks (2009) describe a no-blame system as possessing several characteristics: ■ Individuals are encouraged to report errors and near misses and are rewarded for doing so. ■ A high level of trust and openness allows individuals to exchange opinions without feeling judgment. ■ Purposeful organizational analysis takes place with individuals and groups who experience an error. ■ Managers review and approve","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 1 - The Need for a Paradigm Shift in Healthcare Culture - Old Versus New.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 1 - The Need for a Paradigm Shift in Healthcare Culture - Old Versus New","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 1 - The Need for a Paradigm Shift in Healthcare Culture - Old Versus New_18"}}],["49",{"pageContent":"report errors and near misses and are rewarded for doing so. ■ A high level of trust and openness allows individuals to exchange opinions without feeling judgment. ■ Purposeful organizational analysis takes place with individuals and groups who experience an error. ■ Managers review and approve corrective action plans and communicate lessons learned throughout the organization. ■ There is a learning culture, enabling healthcare organizations to elicit greater staff involvement. ■ Human resources management is integrated in the performance-management process.

Also, in this type of culture, employees become willing to support continuous organizational improvement and to make decisions to strengthen the organization (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006). This can enable organizations to focus on the right things and avoid wasting valuable time. Commercial airlines have led the way in adopting no-blame practices by developing an environment that promotes collaboration and respectful dialogue among pilots. The National Transportation Safety Board has removed the placement of blame from all events except in cases of criminal activity. Gathering information through various approaches—both formal and informal—is encouraged. Pilots and technicians are required to report any issues during operations, including their own errors. Investigations of errors are done systematically, and corrective measures are communicated to all personnel (Roberts, Bea, & Bartles, 2001). ■ Human error ■ Negligence ■ Intentional rule violation ■ Reckless behavior In this type of environment, the individual is coached on his or her risky behavior and the organization learns through the process. High Reliability Organization Theory Organizational and human factors play some role in all accidents and incidents that result in patient harm. HRO theory focuses on the social and organizational foundation of system safety and accident prevention (Sutcliffe, 2011). Reliability is viewed as a top priority. HRO theory also suggests human processes and relationships are the underpinning of an HRO and a culture of safety (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001).

HROs that operate in high-risk environments or have high exposure to liability and loss demonstrate fewer errors than non-HROs. This is achieved through a driven passion for safety that is realized by the pursuit of two approaches (Sutcliffe, 2011): ■ Prevention (anticipation): This involves an attempt to anticipate or identify risks that may lead to unplanned events or occurrences and to then create processes and procedures to avoid them. An example might be proactively shadowing a telemetry monitor technician to observe the application of a telemetry box to a patient and the implementation of continuous monitoring. This example might also involve identifying potential risks of failures in processes to ensure the right patient is connected to the right telemetry box. When transitioning to a blameless culture, a spirit of accountability must play a role in managing human error. Many successful organizations have found that incorporating a disciplinary system that explores the role each person played in an event can foster an environment of organizational learning. In the healthcare industry, this approach is called a Just Culture (Center for Patient Safety, 2015). A Just Culture is characterized by a supportive environment in which the healthcare system or hospital holds itself accountable for the system it designs and holds providers and caregivers accountable for the choices they make within that system.

It also requires resilience (Wildavsky, 1988). The essence of resilience is the ability to maintain or regain a stable state in the presence of stress. Resilience involves three abilities. First is the ability to absorb strain and preserve function in spite of adversity. Second is the ability to bounce back from untoward events. Third is the ability to learn and grow from previous episodes of resilient action (Sutcliffe, 2011).

Three infants received 1,000 times more heparin than intended when vials of 10,000 units per milliliter instead of 10 units per milliliter were used to flush the infants’ vascular access catheters. This error made national news, which placed a spotlight on the hospital’s process for resolving the error. Fortunately, the infants recovered from the event. This event not only affected California, but had an impact on the nation. To prevent future mistakes, the hospital stopped stocking heparin in pediatric units. Only saline is used to flush vascular access lines (Institute for Safe Medication Practices, 2007). In addition, the HRO theory suggests that HROs have an optimistic attitude and focus on internal organizational practices and culture. There is a fundamental belief that reliability is enhanced by rules and standards of practice, technical and social redundancies, teaching, and decision-making that migrates toward expertise (Chassin, 2012). Further expansion into the theory surrounding HROs is the focus on the capability of individuals to make sense of emergent situations and adapt their work to avoid harm (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2015). The History and Background of the HRO Paradigm The initial concept of the HRO paradigm was introduced by a group of researchers at the University of California Berkeley: Todd La Porte, Gene Rochlin, and Karlene Roberts. These researchers examined the links between aircraft carriers, air traffic control, and nuclear power operations (Rochlin, La Porte, & Roberts, 1987; Weick, 1987). Their research found that these industries had similar characteristics, that errors could be minimized through education, and that failures could be avoided by implementing a process to manage complex work and technologies (Rochlin et al., 1987; Weick, 1987). According to Chassin and Loeb (2013), high reliability science is the study of “organizations in industries like commercial aviation and nuclear power that operate under hazardous conditions while maintaining safety levels that are better than in healthcare” (p. 459).

They design their reward and incentive systems to recognize the costs of failures as well as the benefits of reliability. They train their people to look for abnormalities, recognize gaps, and act. Wieck and Sutcliffe (2015) state that HROs manage the unexpected by making the gaps and abnormalities more obvious and making it more difficult to normalize their presence. An HRO consistently shares the big picture of what the organization seeks to do. An important goal is to communicate across the organization in such a way that individuals understand how they fit into the big picture (Chassin & Loeb, 2013).

HRO Principles HROs are unique in their ability both to prevent mishaps and to manage them before they spread throughout the system, thus causing widespread failure. To achieve an HRO environment, an organization must master five principles. As shown in Table 1.1, these principles focus on the practices embedded in the entire organization.

Organizations that adhere to this principle engage in proactive and preemptive analysis and discussion and conduct after-action reviews. Individuals actively search for system signals that something is behaving unexpectedly. There is an understanding that small problems can lead to larger problems. The organization is preoccupied with learning, and it engages in a robust processimprovement program to re-evaluate and assess areas (Chassin & Loeb, 2013). Employees are trained to look for abnormalities, recognize defects, and act. This principle creates an organizational culture that every problem belongs to the operator until the operator fixes it or finds someone else to do so. Reluctance to simplify interpretations This means deliberately questioning assumptions and received wisdom to create a more complete and nuanced picture of current situations. Each potential risk, small or large, is investigated with the same level of intensity. Staff feel open to ask questions and refrain from making assumptions. Understanding complexity goes beyond the capabilities of one individual. As such, a diverse team of experts (not a homogenous group of individuals) is brought together to make an assessment (Sutcliffe, 2011). Sensitivity to operations This refers to ongoing interaction and sharing of information about current human and organizational factors to create an integrated big picture so that small adjustments can be made to prevent errors from accumulating. HROs develop systems and processes to communicate all risks across the organization. They also encourage employees to think about what is happening and how it might affect their areas. Communication is a major challenge for many organizations. Many believe that if there is an awareness of broad risks, one can identify and address small risks before they become a larger problem. continues EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 10:09 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

Deference to expertise This principle holds that during high-tempo times (that is, when attempting to resolve a problem or crisis), decision-making migrates to the person or people with the most expertise with the problem at hand, regardless of authority or rank. In a traditional organization structure, decisions are made by upper management. HROs take a different approach. In HROs, decision-making authority is delegated to the expert in the area in which the problem has arisen (Sutcliffe, 2011). This approach improves the organization’s ability to respond quickly to unexpected events. Adapted from Sutcliffe (2011) To support the five HRO principles, organizations must adopt a fundamental approach in how it communicates and how individuals interact. That means ensuring the following (Chassin, 2012; Chassin & Loeb, 2013): ■ A free flow of information ■ A safe environment in which to speak up ■ Respectful interactions TABLE 1.1 HRO PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS (CONT.) human error will result in continual frustration over adverse events, poor performance, and reactionary measures that focus too heavily on the last person involved in the error. The focus should be on the cumulative effects of organizational breakdowns, flawed defenses, and system failures that allowed the event to occur (Birk, 2015). Table 1.2 displays some areas where the healthcare industry is moving from an old paradigm to a new one that focuses on high reliability. Healthcare providers and organizations will need to become comfortable with the new pay-for-performance models and must lead change in the area of transparency. The number of reportable quality outcomes, which consumers and insurance payers use to make decisions regarding healthcare services, is growing. Private organizations such as U.S. News and World Report (2015), Healthgrades (2015), and the Leapfrog Group (2020) also rank hospitals and quality care outcomes. When employees feel safe, they will be more likely to report concerns and near misses. The Introduction of HRO as a New Paradigm Human errors are inevitable and are caused by complex factors.

Since the passing of the ACA, more accountability is placed on consumers to secure health insurance. Due to the various options and out-of-pocket expenses, consumers are pausing to evaluate the cost of healthcare. Healthcare systems and hospitals are responding to the consumers’ need to understand the value of their healthcare experience by posting quality outcomes and the cost of procedures on their websites. Healthcare systems and hospitals are redirecting their focus toward the needs of the consumers. There is growing evidence that partnering with consumers can lead to improvements in quality, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Consumers are those individuals who autonomously make decisions regarding their health (Mittler, Martsolf, Telenko, & Scanlon, 2013).

Leaders play a role here. To create a culture of safety that focuses on managing risk, increased engagement by leaders is critical (Sutcliffe, 2011). Leaders must commit to creating an environment that encourages team members to speak up. Leaders must also be willing to provide the resources to create a culture of ongoing learning. In the HRO paradigm, quality is a top priority of the healthcare system and hospital’s strategic plan. This occurs when: ■ Measures are aligned with the performance goals of all staff. ■ There is a commitment to the zero-harm goal, starting with the board of trustees.

Application to Healthcare HROs have demonstrated success in minimizing errors by creating mindful environments where employees are trained to look for and report small problems that could lead to big ones. They view these small errors and close calls as learning opportunities; they correct them and share details about them across the organization (Chassin, 2012; Shabot, 2015). For the healthcare industry to make real progress in developing HROs, three things must occur: ■ The leadership team must commit to a goal of zero harm: If a healthcare organization wants the staff to follow HRO practices, it must start at the top. There must be alignment between the board of trustees, physicians, senior leaders, and department managers, all committed to completely eliminating patient harm. ■ HRO principles must be integrated within the organization to develop a culture of safety: Hospitals struggle with this the most.

Although most healthcare systems hospitals have elected to perform annual safety culture surveys, they have not put much effort or resources toward making sustainable changes to strengthen the culture of safety. ■ The organization must adopt a robust process improvement program to improve its quality of care and outcomes: HROs do not specify which process improvement tools and methods to use, but change-management tools, Lean, and Six Sigma are the most widely used. These types of tools incorporate a systematic approach, eliminate waste in the process, and foster discipline in measuring outcomes (Chassin & Loeb, 2013; Sutcliffe, 2011). Why Are HROs Needed? There is overwhelming evidence that preventable patient harm and adverse events continue to occur in US healthcare systems and hospitals. Trends in healthcare outcomes demonstrate that our healthcare system is struggling to deliver consistent and reliable quality care. The dynamics of healthcare are ever-changing, and the pace of this change has made the healthcare industry more difficult for consumers to understand and navigate. Healthcare providers and caregivers work in a complex system with many competing priorities and shrinking revenues. It is as if they are standing on two floating logs—one representing the fee-for-service environment and the other the value-based payment environment. Both of these environments require dedication and focus to be successful. As a result, less attention is directed toward creating HRO environments to drive quality, safety, and service. Healthcare systems and hospitals have not established sustainable solutions to prevent patients from receiving hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). The CDC reported that one in 31 patients in acute care hospitals in the US experienced at least one HAI (n.d.). Worse, approximately 75,000 patients with HAIs died during their hospitalization. Medical errors are a major killer in the US, third only to heart disease and cancer, claiming more than 400,000 lives (James, 2013). In addition to HAIs, there are other preventable risks in the healthcare environment that could be improved by the adoption of HRO principles.

These hazards may include blood-borne pathogens, biological hazards, chemical and drug exposures, ergonomic hazards from lifting patients, and workplace violence, to name a few (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2015). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2011, there were more injury and illness cases in healthcare than in any other industry (2014). Overall, with the challenges and emergent conditions existing within a modern environment of complexity, resilience and rapid adaptation to changing conditions are imperative. For this reason, the principles of high reliability are desired to not only cope but thrive. Benefits to Patient Outcomes, Financials, Safety, and the Work Environment In the healthcare industry, the benefits of integrating HRO principles and practices are significant. HRO phenomena are mainly present in large systems that would benefit greatly from anticipating unexpected events to prevent large system failures (La Porte, 1996). Equally, healthcare systems and hospitals have the potential risk of experiencing large system failures. These risks may include financial and human loss, negative impact on the workforce, or a loss of confidence and trust among members of the community, which could have a devastating effect on any health system or hospital. In embracing HRO practices, health systems and hospitals gain a culture with a strong sense of mission and commitment to reliability in operations and capacity. Organizations that have adopted HRO practices have seen improvement in organizational effectiveness, efficiency, and culture, as well as in customer satisfaction and documentation (TJC Center for Transforming Healthcare, 2015). Such organizations foster and value safety, quality, and management accountability. They also gain a workforce that is highly skilled, knowledgeable, and engaged in the solutions to make their practice and organization safe (Shabot, 2015). There is also benefit on the cost side. The US spends significant amounts of money on treating HAIs and unnecessary procedures and diagnostic tests. Reduction of HAI rates is estimated to save anywhere from $6 billion to $32 billion in healthcare costs (Scott, 2009). A further decline in HAI incidence would have a positive financial impact on the healthcare budget, with funds reallocated to health programs.

A further decline in HAI incidence would have a positive financial impact on the healthcare budget, with funds reallocated to health programs. As well, a collaborative environment and reward and recognition programs, which are both needed for HRO environments to be successful, could have a positive impact on the work environment and employee turnover. Nurses thrive in environments that provide autonomy and allow for their empowerment, that offer a supportive leadership team, and that promote collegial relationships with their team, and evidence shows that satisfied nurses can have a positive impact on patient outcomes (Twigg & McCullough, 2014). 2020: Is the Paradigm Shifting Yet? Since the first edition of this book, high reliability organization (HRO) principles have received much attention and have served as a call to action from national organizations as well as large hospital organizations. However, are we close to reaching a paradigm shift or a tipping point? This section highlights examples of successful applications of high reliability. Veazie, Peterson, and Bourne (2019) published one of the first evidence synthesis reports examining literature about high reliability frameworks, implementation strategies, and measurement as part of the Evidence Synthesis Program for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

This translation of philosophy into practice is key to sustainability of high reliability. The authors reviewed the literature for publications on HRO from calendar years 2010 through 2019 and found 20 relevant articles that describe frameworks for high reliability implementation, evaluation metrics used, and outcomes of HRO implementation on safety outcomes. They based their search on the logic model in Figure 1.1. Many of the relevant articles did not cite improvement metrics, but of the ones that did, the review found organizations that applied five specific implementation strategies were most successful in achieving lower rates of serious safety events. The five common implementation strategies are: 1. Develop leadership: All senior leaders, board members, and lead physicians commit to the goal of zero harm. 2.

Although the implementation of HRO is widespread, research into the effective structure, processes, and outcomes of a successful HRO implementation is in its infancy. However, there are bright spots revealing that HRO is beginning to take hold with established models, training methods, metrics, and practices that can be replicated and tested. The evidence review cited previously is the first step in uncovering the true outcomes of high reliability organizing and disseminating the message.

High reliability is not a fad; it is a change in the way of thinking that changes how we do our daily work. As we examine the external and internal drivers in healthcare, it is obvious that a change is needed. Healthcare organizations are beginning to think differently. The tipping point to high reliability is right where we need it to be, and we need to continue to push.

In the epilogue to the book Zero Harm: How to Achieve Patient and Workforce Safety in Healthcare (2019), James Merlino states that, in order to realize the full promise of high reliability, we need to commit to zero harm and stay the course. He states the need to focus on three strategic and three operational goals: ■ Strategic goals 1. Commit to zero harm. 2. Put patients at the center of everything. 3. Understand the critical interconnectedness of safety, quality, and patient experience—stop competing for resources. ■ Operational goals 1. Drive change using data and transparency—measure what matters and keep it simple. 2. Transform culture and leadership— role-model behaviors of high reliability. 3. Focus on accountability and execution—set goals and timelines for action. At times in healthcare, we try to do everything all at once and lose the traction that we could get from committing to key goals. What if we could commit to these six goals and actually improve outcomes through linking specific implementation tactics to these goals? Many healthcare organizations have done or are in the process of doing exactly that. The time is now for high reliability. The message and reasons why have “stickiness” as described by Gladwell (2002), and with a push from key influences, such as the readers of this book, the tipping point can be achieved. Summary The current healthcare system is complex and is burdened with inefficiencies. Challenges to meeting quality and safety goals are in abundance and lie within and outside of our organizations. Despite the challenges, we have an expectation to be successful and a duty to be reliable. The dynamics of the healthcare system are shifting such that HRO is a viable approach to creating a reliable healthcare system for providers, caregivers, consumers, and the community. Evidence suggests that HRO principles create environments that are mindful of anticipating unexpected events and resilient in responding quickly to minimize exposure. In addition, the use of incident reviews in HROs builds institutional knowledge. Many organizations outside of healthcare have achieved HRO status and have sustained their results over long periods of time (Chassin & Loeb, 2011). Although many healthcare organizations are on the path to adopting HRO principles—and an elite few are close to becoming HROs—we know for sure the road to an HRO requires clear distinct messaging throughout the healthcare system by leaders at all levels of the organization.

After the report’s initial aftershocks, leaders continued the quest to determine causes for medical errors. They launched many improvement efforts to win the confidence of the patients and families they served in their ability to provide safer healthcare. Unfortunately, with the complexity of healthcare delivery, the pace at which this improvement has occurred has not been quick. Although there was a concerted effort to determine the cause of errors in healthcare environments, it quickly came to light that a cultural shift with regard to patient safety would be pivotal to moving organizations forward with meaningful and sustainable safety efforts. Edgar Schein, a noted leader in organizational culture, states that “Culture is an abstraction, yet the forces that are created in social and organizational situations deriving from culture are powerful. If we don’t understand the operation of these forces, we become victim to them” (Schein, 2010, p. 7). Culture can become a ‘secret weapon’ that makes extraordinary things happen. –Jon Katzenbach “ ” Copyright 2021. Sigma. All rights reserved.

It is also imperative that we appreciate the importance of a psychologically safe work environment. In a psychologically safe environment, communication is not hampered based on hierarchy and an unsupportive environment. According to Edmondson (1999), when personal risk is perceived as low, employees are more likely to speak up. We must also embrace the notion of reaching zero defects. When one measures and designs for zero, one invariably uncovers many different ideas, enabling innovation. Aiming for this higher level of performance will set the tone for the culture of the organization and the journey toward high reliability (Yanchus et al., 2012). In a Health Affairs article published in 2013, Mark Chassin commented, “There can be no higher priority today for healthcare leaders than eliminating the barriers to a strong and vibrant culture of safety” (p. 1764). The US healthcare system is striving to create an environment in which zero preventable harm occurs. To achieve this, healthcare organizations have become more interested in high reliability principles and organizations that practice this disciplined approach. One of the central takeaways from these organizations is the importance of a culture of safety, where errors and dangerous conditions are reported with ease and freedom, accountability for adherence to safe practice is embraced, and communication among all team members regardless of rank or education is appreciated and respected. Weick and Sutcliffe (2007) refer to this cultural attitude as “collective mindfulness.” This culture transformation means that everyone who works in an organization is acutely aware of safety and that failure in safe practice and procedures can lead to larger failures. They are designing for zero defects! Understanding Organizational Culture There is no singular correct definition of culture. However, the definition of organizational culture is not so elusive. Bellot (2011) traced the history of organizational culture research and found that most research is within corporate structures. Furthermore, she found consensus in the literature around five basic tenets of organization culture: ■ It exists. ■ It is ambiguous. ■ It is unique and malleable. ■ It is socially constructed and is the product of group interactions. ■ It is adaptable to healthcare. To understand a culture, one must first be aware of drivers of culture. Schein (2010) refers to these areas as “levels of culture.” Schein identified three major areas that help to define or shape culture: ■ Artifacts: These are processes","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 4 - Organizational Culture and the Journey to HRO.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 4 - Organizational Culture and the Journey to HRO","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 4 - Organizational Culture and the Journey to HRO_1"}}],["73",{"pageContent":"a culture, one must first be aware of drivers of culture.

The maturation of an organizational culture measures the ability of that organization to tolerate change and adopt new practices. Measuring the maturity of the organization provides insight into the sustainability of new ideas and concepts. This helps to determine a starting point for aligning efforts to address a particular project within a culture and provides a basic assessment of an organization’s readiness to change (Chassin & Loeb, 2013). In 1990, Rousseau, an anthropological scholar, upheld that organizations were cultures in themselves. Other researchers (Cameron & Quinn, 2006) have embraced the idea that culture is actually an asset of an organization and therefore can be influenced or changed by leadership. Leaders must understand the culture and the maturity of the organization to allow change. They must also be knowledgeable about change concepts and models to steer and guide the change to the organization’s culture. What is the impact of organizational culture to high reliability? High reliability depends on a strong safety culture of anticipation and effective containment of events (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007). Singer et al. (2009) studied the correlation between organizational cultures and safety cultures. The authors found a strong association between organizational culture and patient safety culture. Furthermore, a higher level of group culture was related to higher levels of safety culture, while the opposite was found with hierarchical cultures. The conclusion made was that a mix of culture with a higher emphasis on group values such as teamwork, collaboration, shared decision-making,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 4 - Organizational Culture and the Journey to HRO.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 4 - Organizational Culture and the Journey to HRO","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\High Reliability Organizations - A Healthcare Handbook for Patient Safety & Quality - Chapter 4 - Organizational Culture and the Journey to HRO_2"}}],["74",{"pageContent":"a higher level of group culture was related to higher levels of safety culture, while the opposite was found with hierarchical cultures. The conclusion made was that a mix of culture with a higher emphasis on group values such as teamwork, collaboration, shared decision-making, and participation leads to a higher safety culture. Implications for practice include the implementation of interventions to improve teamwork and reduce hierarchy, leading to substantial improvements in patient safety. Perhaps not coincidentally, these interventions are highly valued in highly reliable organizations. Culture can be an ambiguous and elusive term. It can be considered a “soft” concept, particularly in a world of “hard” science. However, culture is often a factor that holds an organization back or moves it forward toward high reliability. Stages of Learning Leaders must possess a basic knowledge of the general processes of organizational change in order to lead a true change effort. Schein and Bennis defined the stages of learning and change in 1965, and these stages still apply today. The stages are as follows: 1. Individuals within an organization must be motivated to change. For this to occur, they must feel a sense of safety and security. Change is disconcerting and provokes anxiety. 2. Individuals in the organization must learn new concepts, understand new meanings for old concepts, and evaluate concepts with a new lens. Experimentation and small trials become relevant. 3. Individuals in the organization must embrace and internalize the “new” or incorporate new concepts into the culture. Journey to High Reliability: Assessing HRO Maturity So how does an organization or integrated delivery network launch the culture change needed to embark on the journey to high reliability? First, leaders within the organization must understand the change model. They must also realize that to lead change, they need additional information and understanding of the organization. The first step is an assessment of readiness and an understanding of the current state of the culture of safety—in other words, its level of high reliability organization (HRO) maturity.

This survey provides benchmarks for the various questions as well as the ability to perform comparisons with like organizations. This validated survey tool measures a culture of safety in 12 different dimensions. These dimensions cover communication, teamwork, management support of safety efforts, organizational learning or improvement efforts, and nonpunitive response to error, to name a few. Questions support nonpunitive error reporting versus the concepts of just culture and accountability. It is also wise to perform an internal HRO maturity survey that asks members in leadership positions, board members, clinical staff, and nonclinical staff for their views on organizational activities related to reliability. A Colorado healthcare system conducted one such survey. At the time, there were few tools to measure readiness in this area, so we used the Chassin and Loeb (2013) framework High Reliability Health Care Maturity Model (HRHCM) for measurement. The HRHCM has been used widely since its creation to assess maturity of high reliability organizing (Veazie, Peterson, & Bourne, 2019). It includes 14 framework components in three domains, as noted in Table 4.1.

The survey also provided information on system themes that could be utilized in a task force. The team performed a limited electronic survey of clinical leadership, board members, and key physicians.

However, the hope of this healthcare system was to use this assessment and conclusions to formulate system-wide actions leading to the creation of a road map. The timing of this assessment aligned with a Joint Commission survey cycle. The system had many high performers in safety activities and wanted the ability to share best practices and learning across our continuum. To develop and implement the maturity survey, leadership support and backing were necessary. The first step was to create the needed platform for HRO. As stated, the ability to move forward was spurred by the pending Joint Commission survey cycle, which prompted more dialogue and interest in high reliability. The clinical system leadership group was the approval and oversight body for this internal survey, the results, and action plans. Continuing the Journey: HRO Toolkit The survey results demonstrated that on the maturity survey scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being least mature and 4 being fully mature, the system hovered between 2 and 3 in the three main dimensions of leadership commitment, safety culture, and robust process improvement. Analysis of results revealed that visibility of leadership and the board’s commitment to safety were important to the staff. They determined a need to create more opportunities for this visibility in addition to holding town halls and meetings.

The team did not want this journey to be a “project of the month” or to minimize the importance of high reliability. There was a need to generate interest and enthusiasm. The system had experience in putting together chartered and focused evidence-based practice (EBP) teams in the past; this became the platform for putting together a task force dedicated to this effort. The EBP project teams were designed with Dr. David Sackett’s definition of EBP in mind: “Evidence-based medicine is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values” (Sackett, Straus, Richardson, Rosenberg, & Haynes, 2000, p. 1.). They assembled a team of safety and quality experts across the healthcare continuum to put together an intentional plan for a journey to high reliability. A charter was established that identified next steps. The charter enabled the team to identify the mission statement and priorities and created guardrails for the project. The charter defined the purpose of the group as providing a toolkit based in the literature that would support the principles of HRO outlined by Weick and Sutcliffe (2007). The group further defined the membership as well as their roles and expectations. Finally, they ensured that the charter supported our organizational values and mission. Chartering created the necessary guiding principles that enabled the team to come together, divide the components of our work, and create what we termed our HRO toolkit. After the charter was approved, several meetings were spent reviewing both the principles of high reliability and the results from the internal survey and an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Culture of Safety Survey. The five principles of reliability were used to create a grid of current work and proposed future work for the healthcare system. A thorough search of the literature was performed to create a bibliography to support the toolkit components devoted to each principle.

They wanted the toolkit to offer flexibility in the adoption of various tools based on the organization’s environment and culture. That is, they wanted each healthcare entity to choose from a menu of items to implement to support each of the five principles. The goal was to create accountability for implementation but also to offer flexibility to fit both the culture and the stage of maturity of each organization. Table 4.3 lists the components that were provided in the toolkit. Example: Safety Huddle In the area of preoccupation with failure, the organization provided a template and literature to support the carrying out of patient safety huddles. The intent was that individual hospitals could use the template and related instructions to start doing daily safety huddles right away. The result was that within a year, almost all of the organization’s hospitals were doing a daily huddle, which led to a significant difference in the safety culture. Table 4.4 reveals the topics consistently discussed in our daily huddles. One aspect of daily huddles is to recognize good catches and encourage near-miss reporting. The organizations used theme-based materials that they felt fit their culture. These included baseball mitt- and soccer-themed “Good Catch!” certificates to recognize the preemptive reporting of potential patient safety issues. Due to the celebrations of good-catch and near-miss reporting and the celebration of these reports during safety huddles, the organizations realized an increase in event and near event reporting.

The use of red rules began early in the organization’s patient safety journey due to the identified need to tighten accountability around patient identification. However, the organization learned that rather than leading to more reporting of potential system issues, the policy was used more for corrective action. They wanted the culture to support accountability while being able to improve patient safety areas to identify system breakdowns and opportunities to prevent errors. To do this, staff needed to feel comfortable providing feedback and ideas and reporting safety concerns, adverse events, and near events. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement published “A Framework for Safe, Reliable, and Effective Care” in 2017 (Frankel, Haraden, Federico, & Lenoci-Edwards). The overarching domains in this publication focused on culture and the learning system. Psychological safety often imbued as open communication or the ability to speak up was a key component of the culture, and transparency was a demonstration of a supportive learning environment. Amy Edmondson, in her book, Teaming, popularized the concept of psychological safety that had been originated by James Reason. Although most considered speaking up without concerns as psychological safety, Edmondson went on to entail the following four attributes: 1) Anyone can ask questions without looking stupid; 2) Anyone can ask for feedback without looking incompetent; 3) Anyone can be respectfully critical without appearing negative; 4) Anyone can suggest innovative ideas without being perceived as disruptive (Edmondson, 2012). After extensive discussion on the importance of open communication and support of promotion of psychological safety, the organization retired the red rules policy in favor of a new policy that focused on shared accountability and empowering staff to act. This policy stressed speaking up (and being supported for doing so) if a violation of a safety imperative such as hand hygiene or wearing personal protective equipment occurred. They wanted to break from the language we had used in the past and to update the policy on associate performance to include a more thorough explanation of the use of a Just Culture algorithm. The task force included members of the human resources department to help revise these policies and to assist in incorporating training on Just Culture and high reliability principles in new manager and leader orientation.

Physicians who attended the training became eligible for potential malpractice discounts, providing additional motivation. This training was scenario- or situation-based, which helped with the practical translation of the principles of high reliability. A future goal of the task force is to provide greater visibility to Just Culture principles within the peer review structure and functions. Although not fully completed, this is a part of the map for next steps. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving greater reliability. It is a continuous journey that should be aligned with the organization’s state of readiness. The culture of readiness and maturity must be assessed.

This burning platform must move the organization toward a program to realize the capability and quest to have zero harm. We recognize that given the complexity and reliance on human intervention and science in healthcare, errors will occur. As noted by Weick and Sutcliffe, “The hallmark of an HRO is not that it is error-free but that errors don’t disable it” (2007, p. 14). Other industries have proven that with effort and commitment, improvements in prevention and improved safety can occur. In healthcare, we must embrace this journey. We must commit the necessary efforts and resources to provide our caregivers with the support and training to deploy HRO tactics and principles in their everyday practice. In this age of value versus volume in healthcare, providing our patients and consumers with a safer healthcare system that has greater reliability, teamwork, and accountability will translate with ease to the value proposition we all want to offer our patients.

Today, healthcare organization culture leaders are visibly driving safety through daily safety huddles and rounding. They lead their meetings with good catches and near-miss reporting and include staff in solutions to improve patient safety and reliability. Embracing the lessons of industries outside healthcare will help guide the healthcare environment toward improved safety. Value does not always mean the least expensive; it should mean providing the best care and service to our patients without introducing risk and harm. Accountability and leadership will help us drive toward the goal of zero harm and inspire us to address risky behavior or patterns that set us up for failure. High reliability is a journey that does not end, but moves us toward better delivery of value-based care to those we serve! Summary Achieving high reliability involves a continuous journey of improvement. An organization must evaluate a sense of readiness for change through an assessment of maturity and some measurement of the aspects of the culture of safety. Leadership must believe and embrace the idea that this is the highest priority, support a learning environment, promote a culture that is psychologically safe, and support an accountable culture that is foundational to a Just Culture. Each organization’s path to reliability will vary. It is important to evaluate the efforts currently underway in the organization and remove barriers to adopt leading practices in safety and reliability. Healthcare is complex. Understanding that high reliability is a journey can help an organization to draft a road map to enable it to deliver more reliable and safer care. Key Points ■ High reliability is a journey. Thoughtful planning and a burning platform are needed to move an organization through that journey. ■ High reliability is not a one-size-fits-all process. It’s imperative to assess the HRO maturity of an organization before embarking on the journey. EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 10:11 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

We just finished a great WIHI, The Digital Transformation: How Technology is Helping and Hurting Healthcare with you and both Bob Wachter as our experts. So thank you for taking the time. One question that we didn't get to, we touched on the theme a little bit. Technology, we're not there yet in healthcare, there's struggles, there's frustration. People are not happy with technology in healthcare yet. But you and Bob both had sort of a message of hope. So let's go there, why should people be hopeful about technology in healthcare? Well, I think we should be hopeful about technology for a couple of reasons. One, I think we have good evidence to say these technologies can improve the quality and safety of the care we deliver. So no one's saying we should go back to paper. We know that there's going to be this value that these technologies will bring. Second, I think there's a lot of innovation that's happening now. Innovation within vendors, but really in the whole technology community to improve the tools that we have. Third, if you look at other industries, and Bob really highlighted this well during the WIHI, it takes time to optimize these kinds of technologies. He read a very powerful quote about personal computers and how unusable they were back in 1991, and yet look how they are today. So it's unfortunate because it means yes, we might be more in 1991 than today, electronic health records. But it also means that there is that future state that we can aspire to and that it will happen with the innovation and other things that are actively going on right now.

The duty of any healthcare professional is to work with others to provide safe care, treatment, and services using current evidence-based principles, practices, and tools. This section offers a comprehensive overview of safety principles and practices relevant to healthcare delivery across the continuum of care. The safety imperative is discussed and various patient safety programs are described. Patient safety culture approaches and systems thinking principles are examined. Practical tools for assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation that healthcare quality professionals can use in daily practice are reviewed. The successful integration of safety concepts and practices results from leadership commitment and the healthcare workforce understanding about what works (and what does not) in healthcare structure and processes. A culture of safety thrives in a learning organization with effective leadership, an engaged and intentional healthcare workforce, and activated patients. Learning Objectives 1.Provide leadership in the creation and maintenance of a safety culture throughout the organization by assessing needs, developing and deploying the organizational safety plan, and spreading safety concepts using principles such as human factors engineering, high reliability, just culture and systems thinking. 2.Understand how systems of safety, safety culture, reliability, and continuous learning put the patient at the center of safe healthcare delivery. 3.Promote effective risk management strategies through use of safety practices","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_0"}}],["88",{"pageContent":", just culture and systems thinking. 2.Understand how systems of safety, safety culture, reliability, and continuous learning put the patient at the center of safe healthcare delivery. 3.Promote effective risk management strategies through use of safety practices, tools and technology such as incident reporting, sentinel/adverse event review, root cause analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, and checklists. 4.Facilitate the ongoing evaluation and improvement of patient safety using tools and health information technology for identifying risks and harm reduction. The Patient Safety Imperative Eliminating errors and reducing harm are imperative to deliver on the promise of the delivery of care, treatment, and services in a safe environment free of errors and harm. The provision of care, treatment, or services across the continuum is composed of various elements including assessing, planning, providing, and coordinating care to address patient needs. This section synthesizes current knowledge related to patient safety, preventing errors, and reducing harm across the continuum of care. Strategic and operational components of developing a patient safety program are presented. To build an organization’s safety culture means tackling the most important patient safety issues facing healthcare organizations today, which include the following: •Adopting and sustaining a culture of safety •Identifying organizational champions •Deploying and sustaining patient safety strategies •Determining key drivers for patient safety programs •Sustaining the gains of implementing safety innovations •Ensuring the adoption of current and evolving safety-related technologies. There are many aspects of patient safety that are important such as leadership and the mindful integration of safety concepts into an organization’s vision, mission, strategic plan, goals, and objectives. These aspects are discussed in this section. Patient safety practices and approaches to reduce harm and preventable errors are presented. Guidance is offered for using tools and integrating safety into the healthcare organization’s operations and processes. Comprehensive references, resources, and suggested readings are also provided. Note that the term “patient safety” is used throughout but “patient” represents any label for the user of healthcare services across the continuum such as patient, client, resident, consumer, customer, stakeholder, recipient, or partner. Transforming Patient Safety in the 21st Century Medical errors have economic and emotional consequences that are recognized by regulatory requirements for patient safety and error reduction identified in federal, state, and local mandates, standards for practice in accreditation standards (e.g., The Joint Commission [TJC], National Committee for Quality Assurance, and CARF International), and guidance for safe practices","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_1"}}],["89",{"pageContent":"requirements for patient safety and error reduction identified in federal, state, and local mandates, standards for practice in accreditation standards (e.g., The Joint Commission [TJC], National Committee for Quality Assurance, and CARF International), and guidance for safe practices using evidence-based guidelines (e.g., the p. 72 p. 73 National Quality Forum [NQF] and AHRQ Patient Safety Network). The national imperative and patient safety call for action emerged in the first decade of the 21st century. In 1999, the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 was enacted and the call to action released in the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System. In 2000, there was the first National Summit on Medical Errors. Federal actions to reduce medical errors began to appear (e.g., patient safety grants and a national agenda). In 2001, evidence was published about what providers could do to make healthcare safer. By 2007, Patient Safety Indicators were developed, the National Resource Center formed, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Network launched.1 In 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a proposed rule to update payment policies and rates for hospitals under the inpatient prospective payment system (PPS). The rule included new additions of hospital-acquired infections for fiscal year 2009, including several conditions identified by the NQF as “serious reportable adverse events” (also called “never events”).

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation directed the U.S. Department of Health & Human ­Services (HHS) National Quality Strategy (NQS) “to better meet the promise of providing all Americans with access to healthcare that is safe, effective, and affordable.”3(p2) The development of the NQS would occur with input from various stakeholders to influence a realistic, achievable strategy. Thus, the NQF convened the multi-stakeholder National Priorities Partnership comprising 48 public and private sector partners to provide input as HHS developed the NQF goals, measures, and strategic opportunities.3(p2) In 2016, the CMS Quality Strategy pursued the NQS aims (Six Aims and The Triple Aim).

Input to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on priorities for the National Quality Strategy. Washington, DC: National Quality Forum; Copyright 2011, with permission.) In September 2016, CMS furthered its commitment to patient safety when it awarded $347 million to continue progress toward a safer healthcare system. Awards were made to 16 national, regional, or state hospital associations, quality improvement organizations (QIOs), and health system organizations for efforts in reducing hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) and readmissions in the Medicare program. This is only part of broader efforts to transform the healthcare system into one that works better for the American people by delivering better care, spending smartly, and focusing on improved health status. National Strategy for Quality Improvement The National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care5 describes three broad aims of an NQF: better care, healthier people/healthy communities, and affordable care (i.e., The Triple Aim). The NQF also considers six priority areas for an NQF, one of which is to make care safer. The goals include the following: •Improve patient, family, and caregiver experience of care related to quality, safety, and access across settings. p. 74 p. 75 •In partnership with patients, families, and caregivers—­using a shared decision-making process—develop culturally sensitive and understandable care plans. •Enable patients and their families and caregivers to navigate, coordinate, and manage their care appropriately and effectively.3 The NPP envisions “healthcare that honors each individual patient and family, offering voice, control, choice, skills in self-care, and total transparency, and that can and does adapt to individual and family circumstances, and to differing cultures, languages, and social backgrounds.”6(p17) The NPP partners vowed to ensure all patients •provide feedback on the experience of care that healthcare organizations will use to improve care; •access tools and support systems to the effective navigation and management of care; and •access information and assistance that enables informed decisions about treatment options.6(p8) Addressing the","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_5"}}],["93",{"pageContent":"on the experience of care that healthcare organizations will use to improve care; •access tools and support systems to the effective navigation and management of care; and •access information and assistance that enables informed decisions about treatment options.6(p8) Addressing the need to improve the safe delivery of healthcare, Congress passed public and private sector efforts and generated landmark regulations and reports such as the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, in response to the IOM’s groundbreaking report, To Err Is Human. The IOM was renamed in 2016. It is now the Health and Medicine Division, which is a division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (The National Academies). Patient Safety Organizations At the turn of the century, the IOM sparked national attention to avoidable medical errors. Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) evolved from public and private sector concerns. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 20057 conferred privilege and confidentiality protections for providers who choose to work with PSOs. This promotes shared learning from medical errors and improves patient safety across the nation. To implement the Patient Safety Act, HHS issued the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement final rule.8 The Patient Safety Act and the Patient Safety Rule authorized the creation of PSOs to improve quality and safety through the collection and analysis of data on patient events.9 Now many organizations such as the NQF, AHRQ, and CMS are working together to ensure the success of the work accomplished by PSOs. As of December 2016, there are 86 active PSOs in 29 states and the District of Columbia currently listed by AHRQ.10 PSOs are organizations with the shared goal of improving the quality and safety of healthcare delivery. Eight patient safety activities are carried out by, or on behalf of PSOs or healthcare providers, namely, 1.efforts to improve patient safety and the quality of healthcare delivery; 2.collection and analysis of patient safety work product (PSWP); 3.development and dissemination of information regarding patient safety, such as recommendations, protocols, or information regarding best practices; 4.use of PSWP to encourage a culture of safety and provide feedback and assistance to effectively minimize patient risk; 5.maintenance of procedures to preserve confidentiality with respect to PSWP; 6.provision of appropriate security measures with respect to PSWP; 7.use of qualified staff; and 8.activities related to the operation of a patient safety evaluation system","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_6"}}],["94",{"pageContent":"5.maintenance of procedures to preserve confidentiality with respect to PSWP; 6.provision of appropriate security measures with respect to PSWP; 7.use of qualified staff; and 8.activities related to the operation of a patient safety evaluation system and the provision of feedback to participants in a patient safety evaluation system.10 Organizations eligible to become PSOs include public or private entities, profit or not-for-profit entities, provider entities such as hospital chains, and other entities that establish special components to serve as PSOs. By providing privilege and confidentiality, PSOs create a secure environment in which clinicians and healthcare organizations can collect, aggregate, and analyze data. Privileged information is not subject to disclosure or discovery and cannot be asked about in testimony thereby permitting more candid discussions about quality of care that may reduce the risks and hazards associated with patient care. Public Reporting Public reporting in healthcare moved from its starting point with voluntary and/or regulatory agency-driven reporting to mandatory and improvement-focused. Beginning with the reporting of mortality rates by CMS in the 1980s, over the decades more public and private sector reporting development has occurred producing comparable data and science-based methodology. These developments were also framed by stakeholder expectations for accountability, transparency, and improvement. Stakeholders include a host of healthcare providers and payers—government at all levels, health plans, hospitals, ambulatory care, long-term care, physicians and group practices to name a few. Accreditation agencies and private interest groups are stakeholders. And most important, the public and consumer interests and involvement has grown. As the stakeholder base for public reporting expands and diversifies, Halpern et al. suggest that “public reporting should p. 75 p. 76 be used to hold systems accountable to their own goals.”11(p32) In linking quality and patient safety efforts, information should be published on what was learned, recommendations and changes made, and the responsiveness of the institution to patient safety issues. There is no doubt that public reporting offers value related to the allocation of the healthcare dollars but work is still needed to better understand what value is brought to the consumer in choosing a healthcare provider or health plan.12 Twenty-seven states plus the District of Columbia had passed legislation or regulation supporting adverse event reporting to a state agency. The laws and regulations were intended to raise accountability in healthcare organizations.

The laws and regulations were intended to raise accountability in healthcare organizations. Public reporting has the potential to improve patient safety through event analysis and by disseminating lessons learned.13 Eight states use the NQF reportable adverse incident list in their reporting systems; seven states use a modified or partial NQF list, and twelve states use their own non-NQF list.13(p8) The effectiveness of reporting systems is not yet fully understood. However, many reporting system administrators experienced an “impact on communication among facilities, provider education, internal agency tracking or trending, and/or implementation of facility processes to address quality of care. Nine states report increased levels of provider and facility transparency and awareness of patient safety because of their reporting systems.”13(p3) Examples of current public and private sector reporting efforts are described below. Reporting and Tracking. An array of reporting and tracking programs related to patient safety have been deployed by the federal government. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System is a database that contains information on adverse event and product complaint reports. These are submitted to the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. It is designed to support the safety surveillance program. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA. VAERS collects information about adverse events that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the United States. The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) is far reaching in its tracking and reporting for patient safety. Attention to infection prevention and control began to grow as part of the national effort to achieve “zero” in HAIs. Public reporting of infection rates became the “new clinical mandate.”14(p3) The NHSN also plays a leadership role in promoting patient safety by providing a secure, Internet-based safety surveillance system. Through its efforts, it applies quality and safety improvement methods by •collecting and reporting on national and state-specific standardized infection ratios; •providing facilities, states, regions, and the nation with data needed to identify problem areas, measure progress of prevention efforts, and ultimately eliminate healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); and •allowing healthcare facilities to track blood safety errors and important healthcare process measures (e.g., healthcare personnel influenza vaccine status and infection-control adherence rates).15 In October 2014, CMS began reducing Medicare","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_8"}}],["96",{"pageContent":"eliminate healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); and •allowing healthcare facilities to track blood safety errors and important healthcare process measures (e.g., healthcare personnel influenza vaccine status and infection-control adherence rates).15 In October 2014, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for certain hospitals that ranked in the worst performing quartile with respect to HACs. The measures reflect a composite of NHSN data and AHRQ Patient Safety Indicators. Expectations about voluntary and mandatory incident reporting systems (IRS) at organizational and system levels are still evolving. In 1999, the IOM advocated the use of IRS. The IOM recommended that “a nationwide mandatory reporting system should be established that provides for the collection of standardized information by governments about adverse events that result in death or serious harm. Reporting should initially be required of hospitals and eventually be required of other institutional and ambulatory care delivery settings.”16 According to a 2014 study by the ­National Academy for State Health Policy, state-level event reporting systems were launched but have not changed since 2007. As of January 2015, there were 28 states with mandates (see TABLE 2-2). Accreditation organizations, like TJC, have voluntary and mandatory event reporting.

CMS began its hospital and outpatient rating and reporting systems with Hospital Compare in 2002. This was a joint effort between Medicare and the Hospital Quality Alliance (HQA). Over 10 years, CMS and the Alliance worked together to grow public reporting efforts in a meaningful way and beyond structural measures of quality including the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS). The HQA ceased in 2012 after accomplishing its goals. With Hospital Compare and HCAHPS serving as both foundation and experience, CMS continued its development efforts launching other “Compare” programs for healthcare providers across the continuum of care—Physician Compare, Nursing Home Compare, Home Health Compare, Dialysis Facility Compare, and Long-Term Care Hospital Compare. In addition, there are Quality Reporting Systems and Programs for End-Stage Renal Disease, p. 76 p. 77 ambulatory surgical centers, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, inpatient hospitals, inpatient psychiatric facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, outpatient hospitals, physicians, and QIOs. These programs offer payers and consumers valuable tools for value-based purchasing and selecting providers for personal healthcare services and treatment. Performance on safety measures such as readmissions and HAIs are available. Heath Plan Performance. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) develops standards and measures that hold health plans accountable for the care provided to their constituents.

This tool is p. 77 p. 78 used by more than 90% of America’s health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. Because so many plans collect HEDIS data, there is comparability and acceptability by third-party payers. Some patient safety areas addressed by HEDIS include the following: •Safe and judicious antipsychotic use in children and adolescents •HAIs •Follow up after an emergency visit for mental illness, alcohol, and other drug dependence •Falls risk management (RM). HEDIS data are publicly reporting with available benchmarks. The results are used by consumers to select the best health plan for their needs by looking at the plan performance and comparing plan performance with other plans.17 HEDIS reporting is third-party payer requirement for health plans. Safety Grades. The Leapfrog Group is a voluntary initiative that serves to mobilize employer purchasing power to guide America’s health industry in adopting “giant leaps” in patient safety. The group’s mission is “to trigger giant leaps forward in the safety, quality and affordability of U.S. healthcare by using transparency to support informed healthcare decisions and promote high-value care.”18(¶6) In 2001, Leapfrog launched a hospital survey to collect data on three “leaps” (computerized physician order entry, Intensive Care Units [ICUs] appropriately staffed with intensivists, and ensuring enough surgical volume to safely perform certain high-risk procedures). Initially participating hospitals were ranked, but in 2012 Leapfrog began assigning A, B, C, D, and F letter grades. By 2016, the Leapfrog Hospital Survey represented 1,859 hospitals in the United States (60% of hospital beds). Employers and other purchasers as well as health plans and community leaders are using Leapfrog Hospital Survey results and Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades for payment reform and public reporting. Partnership for Patients Partnership for Patients: Better Care, Lower Costs is a public–private partnership to help improve the quality, safety, and affordability of healthcare for all Americans.

Using as much as $1 billion in new funding provided by the ACA and leveraging several ongoing programs, the DHHS works with a wide variety of public and private partners to achieve the two core goals of this partnership: keep patients from getting injured or sicker in the healthcare system, and help patients heal without complication by improving transitions from acute-care hospitals to other care settings, such as home or a skilled nursing facility. Its mission is to help patients take care into their own hands. The partnership uses Hospital Improvement Innovation Networks that work at the regional, State, national, or hospital system level to sustain and accelerate national progress and momentum toward continued harm reduction in the Medicare program. Beyond reducing harm caused in hospitals, the Partnership for Patients is an important test of what can occur when the nation acts as one to address a major national health problem. The CMS Innovation Center dedicated more than $500 million to test models of safer care delivery and promote implementation of best practices in patient safety. The Innovation Center “allows the Medicare and Medicaid programs to test models that improve care, lower costs, and better align payment systems to support patient-centered practice.”19(¶1) In addition, CMS provided $500 million for a community-based care transition program created by the ACA to support hospitals and community-based organizations in helping Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for readmission to the hospital safely transition from the hospital to other care settings. More than 7,300 partners, including more than 3,200 hospitals, physicians, nursing groups, consumer groups, and employers have pledged their commitment to the Partnership for Patients.5,20 The Six Aims The IOM highlighted problems in healthcare delivery. In the seminal IOM report, the Committee on Quality of Health Care in America stated healthcare frequently harms and routinely fails to deliver its potential benefits. It was noted that the American healthcare delivery system needed fundamental change.21(p1) In addition, it concluded healthcare was not being provided with the best scientific knowledge. The IOM report suggested an agenda for “crossing the chasm” by changing the healthcare delivery system. Its agenda includes the following components: •All healthcare constituencies (e.g., purchasers, healthcare professionals, regulators, consumers) can commit to a national statement of purpose for the healthcare system, setting six aims for improvement to raise the quality of care to unprecedented levels. •Clinicians, patients, and healthcare organizations need to adopt a new set of principles","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_12"}}],["100",{"pageContent":", regulators, consumers) can commit to a national statement of purpose for the healthcare system, setting six aims for improvement to raise the quality of care to unprecedented levels. •Clinicians, patients, and healthcare organizations need to adopt a new set of principles to guide the redesign of care processes. •Through the DHHS, a set of priorities must be identified to focus initial efforts, provide resources to stimulate innovation, and initiate the change process. •Healthcare organizations need to design and implement more effective support processes to make change in the delivery of care possible. An environment needs to be created to foster and reward improvement in the context of ever-expanding knowledge and rapid change. This is accomplished by creating an infrastructure p. 78 p. 79 that supports evidence-based practice, uses information technology (IT), aligns incentives with outcomes, and prepares the workforce to better provide care, treatment, and services. As part of the agenda for change, the IOM outlined six improvement aims to address key dimensions of healthcare quality. At a minimum, healthcare should remain as follows: 1.Safe: Avoid injuries to patients from care that is intended to help them. 2.Effective: Provide care based on scientific knowledge regarding who will likely benefit, and restrain from providing care when it is not likely to benefit a patient. 3.Patient-Centered: Care is respectful and responsive to patient preferences, needs, and values. Furthermore, patient values and preferences guide clinical decisions. 4.Timely: Wait times and harmful delays for those who receive and provide care are eliminated. 5.Efficient: Care is provided in ways that avoid waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. 6.Equitable: Care does not vary in quality because of the patient’s personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.21 Since the IOM started delivering reports on patient safety in 2000, various national organizations, state and federal agencies, accreditation organizations, and professional associations have focused on the identification of safe practices and strategies for organizational or system-wide implementation. In addition, many states have established coalitions to promote patient safety. For example, the Connecticut Center for Patient Safety promotes “high quality, safe healthcare and the rights of patients by promoting person-centered care, best practices and transparency in healthcare.”22(¶2) Originally organized by residents who had been harmed by the healthcare system, it provides useful tools and resources for consumers.

The Oregon Patient Safety Commission (OPSC) was one of the first legislatively mandated organizations to reduce the risk of serious adverse events occurring in Oregon’s healthcare system and encourages a culture of patient safety through patient safety reporting, early discussion and resolution, and quality improvement initiatives.23 The Triple Aim The Triple Aim was introduced by Berwick et al.24—improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of healthcare. Since it was introduced, thinking about the Triple Aim continues to evolve. A fourth aim or quadruple aim was proposed by Sikka et al.25 who suggest adding improving the experience of providing care, including workforce engagement and workforce safety. Bodenheimer and Sinsky26 suggest that the goal be added of improving the worklife of healthcare providers, including clinicians and staff. Organizations such as the American Hospital Association (AHA) continue advancing work in patient safety using the Triple Aim to frame principles for practice. In 2016, the AHA reaffirmed its commitment to creating safe and highly reliable healthcare organizations through a culture of high reliability whereby hospitals improve quality and patient safety.27 CMS reframed the aims simply as Better Care, Smarter Spending, Healthier People as the federal government extends financial support for innovation and efforts continue to improve the healthcare delivery system in the United States. In fact, health outcomes are improving and adverse events are decreasing as patient safety improved dramatically, thanks in part to the Partnership for Patients. Patient harm fell by 17%, saving 50,000 lives and billions of dollars.28 Patient-Centered Outcomes Established in 2012, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has “a sizeable and growing portfolio of projects designed to improve patient care and outcomes through patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER). The research fund is guided by the PCORI five National Priorities for Research and Research Agenda. The work under these priorities is managed by our scientific programs, which track it and evaluate its effectiveness.”29,30(¶1) PCORI established national priorities for patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness that include the following: •Assessment of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options: Comparing the effectiveness and safety of alternative prevention,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_14"}}],["102",{"pageContent":"evaluate its effectiveness.”29,30(¶1) PCORI established national priorities for patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness that include the following: •Assessment of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options: Comparing the effectiveness and safety of alternative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options to see which one works best for different people with a health problem. •Improving Healthcare Systems: Comparing health ­system–level approaches to improving access, supporting patient self-care, innovative use of health IT, coordinating care for complex conditions, and deploying workforce effectively. •Communication and Dissemination Research: Comparing approaches to providing comparative effectiveness research information, empowering people to ask for and use the information, and supporting shared decision-making between patients and their providers. •Addressing Disparities: Identifying potential differences in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment effectiveness, or preferred clinical outcomes across patient populations and the healthcare required to achieve best outcomes in each population. •Accelerating Patient-Centered Outcomes Research and Methodological Research: Improving the nation’s capacity to conduct patient-centered outcomes research, by building data infrastructure, improving analytic methods, and training researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to participate in this research.30(¶2) p. 79 p. 80 Contextualizing Patient Safety Patient safety reflects science, encompasses practices and interventions, and aims to reduce the occurrence of preventable events. It requires intention, vigilance, and trust to build a culture of safety. These are important as one considers the person and the healthcare delivery system. Patient safety and quality improvement are intertwined. Different techniques can be used to assess performance with the findings used to inform change. “It is important to adopt various process-improvement techniques to identify inefficiencies, ineffective care, and preventable errors, and influence changes associated with systems.”31(p3-1) Through the work of various government, quasi-government, and voluntary groups, different definitions emerged that address the prevention of errors and the reduction of harm, such as the following: •Patient safety is the “freedom from accidental injury due to medical care or medical errors.”16(p4) •Patient safety is “indistinguishable from the delivery of quality health care,”32(p5) in a culture of safety where “. . . caregivers are encouraged to report medical errors, ‘near misses,’ or adverse events, where they can be discussed in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect without fear of blame or retribution.”33(p195) •Patient safety","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_15"}}],["103",{"pageContent":"safety where “. . . caregivers are encouraged to report medical errors, ‘near misses,’ or adverse events, where they can be discussed in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect without fear of blame or retribution.”33(p195) •Patient safety refers to the “freedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care. Thus, practices or interventions that improve patient safety are those that reduce the occurrence of preventable adverse events.”34(¶1) •Patient safety is “a discipline in the health care sector that applies safety science methods toward the goal of achieving a trustworthy system of health care delivery. Patient safety is also an attribute of health care systems; it minimizes the incidence and impact of, and maximizes recovery from, adverse events.”35(p6) •Patient safety is “the prevention and mitigation of harm caused by errors of omission or commission that are associated with healthcare, and involving the establishment of operational systems and processes that minimize the likelihood of errors and maximize the likelihood of intercepting them when they occur.”36 •Patient safety is a public health issue. It is “the absence of preventable harm to a patient during the process of health care. The discipline of patient safety is the coordinated efforts to prevent harm, caused by the process of health care itself, from occurring to patients.”37(¶3) Considering any one of these definitions, one can quickly recognize that there are myriad of patient safety issues across the continuum of care that demand consideration (e.g., hazards and patient complexities in behavioral health environments or the outpatient settings). Some issues may be less obvious but just as serious. Some issues are experienced by most types of healthcare organizations. However, there are issues unique to the setting where care, treatment, and services are provided.

See Performance and Process Improvement and Organizational Leadership sections for more information about frameworks and tools used in quality and performance improvement. p. 80 p. 81 p. 81 p. 82 Systems Thinking and Patient Safety Whereas “do no harm” was previously an individual responsibility, a paradigm shift makes “safety a system priority.”21(p67) When patient harm occurs, the cause is frequently traced to flaws in the system of care. Adopting “systems” thinking requires a healthcare organization to think beyond the person and beyond blame. Whereas individual behavior can result in an error, looking at health delivery from a systems perspective enables the organization to identify and manage errors differently. Using a systems approach, the conditions under which an individual works and the complexity of the process are the foci. By recognizing human and process variability in a systemic way, leadership and healthcare personnel can work together to avert errors or mitigate their effects. This is foundational to high-reliability organizations (HROs), which will be discussed later in this section. Patient Safety Culture The current era of patient safety ushered in thinking such as achieving zero defects, pursuing perfection, and transforming healthcare.38–40 This thinking influences how organizations create the strategy for culture of safety goals and objectives. Although everyone in the healthcare enterprise is responsible for quality and safety, an organization’s leadership must emphasize safety as a core component of culture, ongoing strategy planning, and of their quality and performance improvement program. Designing an organizational structure for patient safety is like designing a house: Like the physical structure of a house, organizational structure identifies and distinguishes the individual parts of an organization and ties these pieces together to define an integrated whole.

In 2017, TJC explained that the role of leadership is essential in developing the safety culture and described 11 tenets that help an organization achieve and sustain a safety culture.43 See FIGURE 2-2 for a description of these tenets. Figure 2-2 11 tenets of a safety culture. (Reprinted from The Joint Commission. Addition resources.

This may typically start at the strategic planning stage with the mission and vision statements, core values, and strategic goals. Reason44,45 suggested that different safety culture elements can be considered: •Informed culture: Culture in which everyone is clear about acceptable and unacceptable actions. Being informed is supported by the availability of safety data that is actively disseminated. •Reporting culture: Errant behaviors can be reported without fear of punishment or blame. •Learning culture: An organization can learn from its mistakes and make changes. •Flexible culture: The organization and the people in it can adapt effectively to changing demands. •Just culture: Errors and unsafe acts are not punished if the error was unintentional. Those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks are still be subject to disciplinary action. Healthcare organizations committed to a just culture identify and correct the systems or processes of care contributing to the medical error, adverse events, near miss, or close call—they do not assign blame.

It is important that the organization is clear about terms used for identifying, investigating, reporting, and disclosure of safety events. Errors, adverse events, preventable adverse events, and sentinel events are described as follows: •Medical error: An error is defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim. Errors can include problems in practice, products, procedures, and systems.46 •Adverse event: An injury caused by something that happened in the delivery of medical care rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the patient. How adverse events might be categorized could be determined by setting (e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility). Adverse events are sometimes further categorized as follows: ⚬Preventable adverse events: Those that occurred due to error or failure to error or system design flaw. ⚬Ameliorable adverse events: Events that, while not preventable, could have been less harmful if care had been different. ⚬Adverse events due to negligence: Those that occurred due to care that falls below the standards expected of clinicians in the community.47 •Sentinel event: A sentinel event is a patient safety event that reaches a patient and results in death, permanent harm, severe temporary harm, and/or intervention required to sustain life. An event can also be considered sentinel if the event signaled the need for immediate investigation and response.48 p. 82 p. 83 Close calls and near misses are those that never reached a patient, may have reached a patient or reached a patient with no serious harm. Near misses and close calls may be recognized and defined as follows: •An event, situation, or error that took place but was captured before reaching the patient.49 •An act of commission or omission that had the potential to harm a patient but did not occur due to a planned/unplanned recovery or corrective action and timely intervention.50,51 p. 83 p. 84 •An event or situation that did not produce patient harm due to either chance or capture before reaching the patient or if it did reach the patient, a timely and robust intervention occurred with no subsequent patient harm.52 •An error of commission or omission that could have harmed the patient but serious harm did not occur due","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_22"}}],["110",{"pageContent":"to either chance or capture before reaching the patient or if it did reach the patient, a timely and robust intervention occurred with no subsequent patient harm.52 •An error of commission or omission that could have harmed the patient but serious harm did not occur due to chance, prevention, or mitigation.53 Understanding errors and feeling protected by a nonpunitive culture, more healthcare professionals will report errors, near-misses, and close calls. This in turn will improve patient safety through opportunities for improvement identified and lessons learned.54,55 In a just culture, there is awareness throughout the organization that medical errors are inevitable—humans make errors, systems can be flawed. Just Culture can make the system safer by recognizing competent professionals make mistakes. It also acknowledges that even competent professionals develop unhealthy norms (shortcuts or routine rule violations); nevertheless, this culture has zero tolerance for reckless behavior. Three principles of a just culture are described here: 1.Just culture is not an effort to reduce personal accountability and discipline. It is a way to emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes, near misses, and close calls to reduce future preventable errors. 2.An individual is accountable to the system and the greatest error is to not report a mistake. Doing so prevents the system and others from learning. 3.Policies discouraging any healthcare provider from self-reporting errors are at odds with the goals of a fair and just culture. Even those errors that do not result in harm or injury are reported and serve as learning opportunities. Success occurs when everyone in a healthcare organization serves as a safety advocate regardless of their position or role. Providers and consumers will feel safe and supported when they report medical errors or near misses and voice concerns about patient safety. How are the human/emotional aspects associated with patient safety balanced with how the system reflects and responds to those human emotions? In building a safety culture, Botwinick and colleagues42 noted when leaders begin asking what happened instead of who made the error, the culture within their healthcare institutions begin to change. Patient-Centered Care Consumers are becoming more engaged in healthcare decision-making and more willing to tell their stories to the public when things do not go right. One of the most poignant was the Josie King incident.

Josie’s mother, Sorrel King, later went public with the findings about the breakdowns leading to her daughter’s death at a premier medical system in Baltimore, MD. The Josie King Foundation was established with the mission to “encourage a culture of safety by providing tools that allow health care organizations the ability to communicate, collaborate, improve and share.”56(¶3) Together with the hospital and provider groups, King also founded the Patient Safety Group in 2004, which upholds the mission to “encourage a culture of safety by providing tools that allow healthcare organizations the ability to communicate, collaborate, improve, and share.”57(¶1) Healthcare professionals respect and include patients and families in decision-making. They keep the patient and the family at the center of all that they do. Research suggests that clinicians working with patients and their families can contribute to a better understanding of their role and ­responsibilities related to safety. A Cochrane ­systematic ­review including 115 controlled studies ­representing 34,444 ­research participants reported that providing patients with decision aids •improves knowledge regarding their options, •reduces the decisional conflict, •increases active role in decision-making, •improves accurate risk perceptions of possible benefits and harms among patients, •increases the likelihood that choices are more consistent with their informed values, and •enhances communication between the patient and the clinicians.58(¶15) Activated patients—those who manage their own care by having the knowledge, skills, and confidence—are shown to achieve better clinical outcomes.59 The healthcare quality professional’s role includes support of a person-centered approach in developing safety programs and fostering patient and staff engagement. Safety can be advanced through the consideration of different aspects of clinical excellence such as psychological safety (creating an environment where people are comfortable and have opportunities to raise concerns and questions), leadership (facilitating and monitoring teamwork, improvement, respect, and psychological safety), and transparency (openly sharing data and other information concerning safe, respectful, and reliable care with staff, partners, and families).

As consumers become more empowered through consumer-directed healthcare, they will demand more from healthcare organizations. Examples of initiatives to consider in program development for consumer-directed healthcare include the following: •SPEAK UP Program. TJC empowers consumers by providing educational materials and tools as navigational aids for complex healthcare systems. In 2002, in response p. 84 p. 85 to a public outcry regarding unsafe practices, TJC, in collaboration with CMS, launched a national campaign to urge consumers to take an active role in identifying and preventing healthcare errors. The goal of the initiative was to empower consumers to become active, involved, and informed participants on the healthcare team.60 •OpenNotes. Since 2010, this national initiative funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, gives patients access to the visit notes written by their doctors, nurses, or other clinicians. Potential positive effects of using an open medical record include catching errors in the notes, preventing diagnostic delay, taking medications as prescribed, encouraging patients to speak up, engaging informal caregivers, and enhancing trust.61,62 OpenNotes has been adopted by facilities and systems of care such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Geisinger Health Systems. What is known is that engagement results in patient safety outcomes.63 The healthcare quality professional can work with others in the organization to determine how elements of engagement can be incorporated into strategic intent, the safety plan, and other related activities (e.g., structure to support engagement, needed skills, awareness building, and practices). Health Equity One of the six aims of a quality healthcare system is equity. In a perfect world, equitable care does not vary based on a patient’s individual characteristics such as sex, gender identity, ethnicity, geographic location, or socioeconomic status.

However, disparities exist and include (1) the way healthcare systems are organized and operate; (2) patient attitudes and behaviors; and (3) healthcare provider biases, prejudices, and uncertainty when treating minorities.64(pp2–3) Medical errors can result from ineffective patient-provider communication and the inability of the treating providers to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers. Effective and safe medical treatment depends on good communication between the healthcare team and patient. Cultural competence is an important component of patient safety. Full buy-in from the organization’s senior decision-makers is essential to the success of any cultural competency initiative. Cross and colleagues defined cultural competence as “a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes and policies that come together in a system, agency, or amongst professionals and enables that system, agency and those professionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations.”65(p iv) Lack of cultural competence affects healthcare and patient safety. p. 85 p. 86 Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) comprise 8.6% of the U.S. population, or 25 million people.66 Patients with LEP have increased risk for adverse events. Divi et al.67 found that 49.1% of LEP patients experienced physical harm compared with the 29.5% of non-LEPs. In addition, LEP patients experienced higher levels of physical harm (46.8%) compared with their non-LEP counterparts (24.4%). Communication is the third most common root cause of sentinel events and unexpected events, which cause death or serious physical or psychological injury.68 Because of inequities, individuals across the United States are unable to reach their optimal health potential. Inequities in healthcare are influenced by “social determinants of health, or those conditions in which individuals are born, grow, live, work and age.”69(¶1) One of the most modifiable factors is the lack of CLAS, broadly defined as “care and services that are respectful of and responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of all individuals.”70(¶1) Various models are proposed to describe cultural competence as a patient-­centered approach.

A patient safety practice is “a type of process or structure whose application reduces the probability of adverse events resulting from exposure to the healthcare system across a range of diseases and procedures”73(p13) Applicability of various safety practices is dependent upon many factors, including the healthcare setting, the populations served, high-risk processes, volume-driven practices, and previous performance data. Organizations can use quality tools such as a prioritization matrix to select safety standards relevant to their populations served. Leadership works with others in the organization to prioritize needs, select practices for improvement, allocate resources to successfully implement patient safety practices, and ensure commitment to interventions and improvement are sustained over time. The governing board and medical leadership participate in the analysis and prioritization process. Patient safety practices are integrated into the organization’s strategic direction. Goals are developed that are both realistic and aspirational. Various national organizations employ consensus-driven processes to identify patient safety practices to be adopted by healthcare organizations. Because there is now an abundance of consensus-driven standards, healthcare quality professionals can look to the tried and true work of others to develop their own safety practices. For example, recommendations can be found in Safe Practices for Better Healthcare: 2010 Update.74 These are summarized in TABLE 2-5. Table 2-5 Safe Practices for Better Healthcare—2010 Update Safe Practice Practice Statement Safe Practice 1: Leadership Structures and Systems Leadership structures and systems must be established to ensure organization-wide awareness of patient safety performance gaps, direct accountability of leaders for those gaps, and adequate investment in performance improvement abilities, and that actions are taken to ensure safe care of every patient served.

Safe Practice 5: Informed Consent Ask each patient or legal surrogate to “teach back,” in his or her own words, key information about the proposed treatments or procedures for which he or she is being asked to provide informed consent. Safe Practice 6: Life-Sustaining Treatment Ensure that written documentation of the patient’s preferences for life-sustaining treatments is prominently displayed in his or her chart. Safe Practice 7: Disclosure Following serious unanticipated outcomes, including those that are clearly caused by systems failures, the patient and, as appropriate, the family should receive timely, transparent, and clear communication concerning what is known about the event. Safe Practice 8: Care of the Caregiver Following serious unintentional harm resulting from systems failures and/or errors that resulted from human performance failures, the involved caregivers (clinical providers, staff, and administrators) should receive timely and systematic care to include: treatment that is just, respect, compassion, supportive medical care, and the opportunity to fully participate in event investigation and risk identification and mitigation activities that will prevent future events. Safe Practice 9: Nursing Workforce Implement critical components of a well-designed nursing workforce that mutually reinforce patient safeguards, including the following: •a nurse staffing plan with evidence that it is adequately resourced and actively managed and its effectiveness is regularly evaluated with respect to patient safety; •senior administrative nursing leaders, such as a chief nursing officer, are part of the hospital senior management team; •governance boards and senior administrative leaders that take accountability for reducing patient safety risks related to nurse staffing decisions and the provision of financial resources for nursing services; and •provision of budgetary resources to support nursing staff in the ongoing acquisition and maintenance of professional knowledge and skills.

Like many strategies, [Moody’s] recognize[s] that realizing financial returns from a quality strategy may require large capital costs and incurred operating losses in the short term. However, over the long term, a hospital’s focus on quality will be viewed as a credit positive if greater patient demand and financial improvements materialize. Many not-for-profit hospitals are launching strategies to improve evidence-based clinical outcomes and patient safety, which we view as the two key facets of a strategy aimed at improving quality. The effort to improve quality is a major component of most hospitals’ mission to provide the best patient care possible.75(p1) These perspectives are critical to the conversations about the business case for quality and safety. When providing quality care and reducing harm as part of an organization’s strategy, the board, executives, and medical staff have the opportunity for continual, transparent, and data-informed deliberations about capital and human resource investments. And in doing so, consider harm and its impact on the bottom-line. This criticality was underscored by a recent Moody’s report on for-profit and not-for-profit hospital performance whereby technological innovation in healthcare will likely lead to lower patient volumes at both for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. However, for hospitals at the forefront of healthcare technology, the benefits of innovation will outweigh the reduction in volumes. Telemedicine and remote monitoring, particularly for high-risk populations, will reduce emergency room visits and inpatient admissions because they will improve preventative care.

Better care, smarter spending, healthier people. Patient safety must be integrated by leadership into strategic planning. Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)77 outlines six things all boards can consider in their effort to improve quality and reduce harm: 1.Learning, starting with the board: Develop capability as a board. Learn how the best boards work with executives and physician leaders to reduce harm. Set an expectation for similar levels of education and training for all staff. 2.Establishing executive accountability: Oversee the effective execution of a plan to achieve aims to reduce harm, including executive team accountability for clear performance improvement targets. 3.Setting aims: Set a specific aim to reduce harm this year. Make an explicit public commitment to measurable quality improvement (e.g., a reduction in unnecessary mortality and harm), establishing a clear aim for the facility or system. 4.Establishing and monitoring system-level measures: Identify a small group of organization-wide measures of patient safety (e.g., facility-wide harm, risk-adjusted mortality), update the measures continually, and make them transparent to the entire organization and customers. 5.Gathering data and hearing stories: Select and review progress toward safer care as the first agenda item at every board meeting; progress is grounded in transparency and a desire to put a human face on harm data. 6.Changing the environment, policies, and culture: Commit to establishing and maintaining an environment that is respectful, fair, and just for all who experience pain and loss because of avoidable harm and adverse outcomes. With the convergence of clinical care, safety priorities, and economic stability, board members’ interest will increase over time and create opportunities for healthcare quality professionals to educate organizational leaders on the importance of attending to patient safety. “Board oversight of quality and","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_38"}}],["126",{"pageContent":"outcomes. With the convergence of clinical care, safety priorities, and economic stability, board members’ interest will increase over time and create opportunities for healthcare quality professionals to educate organizational leaders on the importance of attending to patient safety. “Board oversight of quality and patient safety rests on the directors’ ability to obtain, process, and interpret information; assess current performance; and set strategic direction using a range of metrics tailored to local circumstances.”78(p754) Over 100 consensus standards with a focus on patient safety are endorsed by NQF. The first of the 34 endorsed practices are Leadership Structures and Systems.79 This safe practice for leadership provides an overview of the leadership structures and systems deemed critical to the organization-wide awareness of patient safety performance gaps, direct accountability of leaders for those gaps, and adequate investment in performance improvement abilities, along with the actions necessary to ensure safe care of every patient served.74 The four distinct elements within the NQF-endorsed safe practice of Leadership Structures and Systems are outlined below. p. 92 p. 93 Awareness Structures and Systems Awareness structures and systems provide leaders with continuous information about potential risks, hazards, and performance gaps that may contribute to patient safety issues. These structures and systems include (a) identification of risks and hazards; (b) culture management, feedback, and intervention; (c) direct patient input; and (d) governance board and senior management briefings and meetings. Accountability Structures and Systems Accountability structures and systems enable leaders to establish direct accountability to the governing body, senior management, mid-level management, physician leaders, and frontline staff. Included in these structures and systems are (a) the patient safety program, (b) the patient safety officer, (c) direct organization-wide leadership accountability, (d) an interdisciplinary patient safety committee, and (e) external reporting activities. Structures and Systems-Driving Ability Structures and systems-driving ability allows leaders to assess the capacity, resources, and competence necessary to implement change in the culture and in patient safety performance. This ability includes (a) patient safety budgets, (b) people systems, (c) quality systems, and (d) technical systems. Action Structures and Systems Action structures and systems enable leaders to take direct and appropriate action.

Measures of success should align the incentives for the improvement of patient safety. Rogers’s work on disseminating innovations is also applicable to the widespread adoption of safety practices.80 A comprehensive discussion of change and innovation can be found in Performance and Process Improvement. Also, see Organizational Leadership for more information about leadership, quality improvement, and strategy. Patient Safety Principles and Practices Human error is inevitable, even among the most conscientious professionals who are practicing the highest standards of care. Human error happens when “there is general agreement that the individual should have done other than what they did, and in the course of that conduct inadvertently causes or could cause an undesirable outcome, the individual is labeled as having committed an error.”81(p6) Identification and reporting of human error events are critical to an organization’s efforts to continuously improve patient safety and contribute to a robust learning environment. Likewise, healthcare leaders have a duty to recognize the inevitability of human error, design systems that make such error less likely, and avoid punitive reactions to honest errors. Pham et al.82 offer that IRS can help the organization identify local system hazards, bolster the patient safety culture, and share lessons within and across organizations. Incident reporting, however, should not be the only component of an enterprise-wide patient safety program. A formal patient safety program is part of system design. The program considers the following: •Mission, vision, core values, and goals of the organization •Interrelationships between and among functions, departments and disciplines •Acknowledging differences in the patient safety mindset •Silos that might exist for overlapping or misaligned goals and objectives •Forming cross-departmental teams for collaboration •Identifying where processes can be streamlined to improve organizational or system effectiveness.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_40"}}],["128",{"pageContent":"and disciplines •Acknowledging differences in the patient safety mindset •Silos that might exist for overlapping or misaligned goals and objectives •Forming cross-departmental teams for collaboration •Identifying where processes can be streamlined to improve organizational or system effectiveness.

It describes how efforts are coordinated to support organization-wide assessment, evaluation, and improvement of interrelated processes. Different aspects of the plan can include the following: •Governance and leadership •Goals and objectives •Planning, designing, and redesigning safe processes •Culture of safety •Reduction of preventable errors (e.g., identifying and mitigating risks and hazards, adverse events, sentinel events, and peer review processes) •Adherence to clinical practice guidelines •Patient, family, and caregiver engagement p. 93 p. 94 •Measurement, monitoring, and evaluating program effectiveness/success •Transparency and dissemination of results across the organization. The healthcare quality professional can guide the organization in determining which performance improvement methodology can be adopted proactively and retrospectively. An organization also can look to build the skills of those working on improving patient safety, such as avowing common pitfalls when conducting a root cause analysis (RCA)83 and developing strong harm reduction actions that are sustainable. Harm Reduction The IOM report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System,21 and its subsequent reports, garnered the attention of providers, payers, and consumers by illustrating the direct relationship between quality of care and patient outcomes. Further, Becher and Chassin84 pointed out the experience of patient harm as the result of three types of quality issues: underuse, overuse, and misuse of health services. Underuse occurs when patients do not receive beneficial health services. For instance, only 10% of patients who have an addiction problem receive treatment.85 Overuse occurs when patients undergo treatment or procedures from which they do not benefit (e.g., X-rays performed on patients with back pain are unnecessary). Misuse occurs when patients receive appropriate medical services provided poorly, adding to the risk for preventable complications. Underuse, overuse, and misuse are considered waste and waste is costly. Berwick and Hackbarth86 believe the best healthcare reform and cost reduction strategy is to eliminate waste.

Total waste cost of the United States was $558 billion to $1,263 billion in 2011. These are examples of waste related to harm reduction: 1.Failures of care delivery: Waste from poor execution or lack of best practice adoption resulting in injuries and poor outcomes ($102 billion to $154 billion). 2.Failures of care coordination: Waste related to fragmented care resulting in complications, readmissions, declines in functional status, and increased dependency of the chronically ill ($25 billion to $45 billion). 3.Overtreatment: Waste from rendering care that is not useful ($158 billion to $226 billion). Human Factors Human factors (also called human factors engineering) “is the application of knowledge about human capabilities (physical, sensory, emotional, and intellectual) and limitations to the design and development of tools, devices, systems, environments, and organizations. . . .”87(p1) The human factors associated with healthcare personnel and patient safety are complex. Employee attitudes, motivation, physical and psychological health, education, training, and cognitive functioning can influence the likelihood of a medical error. In healthcare, 85% of errors are the result of systems issues, and 15% are attributable to human factors.88 According to IHI, “The key to reliable, safe care does not lie in exhorting individuals to be more careful and try harder. It lies in learning about causes of error and designing systems to prevent human error whenever possible.”77(p19) Causes for human error are important in system design and redesign. Examples of human factors found to contribute to errors include the following: •Human interaction with machines •Workload leading to errors and mistakes in providing the best care for patients, when there are not enough staff to handle the workload or work hours are inadequate •Disruptive behavior of healthcare personnel that undermines a culture of patient safety89 •Fatigue and stress leading to less than expected performance.90(p100) Any improvement efforts focused on eliminating errors requires a just culture, detailed analysis of the care delivery process, human factors influencing processes of care, and the resources to bring about sustained system change.

Drawing from many other disciplines such as anatomy, physiology, physics, biomechanics, and ergonomics, the IHI defines human factors as “the study of all the factors that make it easier to do the work in the right way”91(¶1) The science applied to healthcare fosters these principles in designed work processes: •Simplify to take steps out of a process. •Standardize to remove variation and promote predictability and consistency. •Use forcing functions and constraints that makes it impossible to do a task incorrectly and creates a hard stop that cannot be passed unless actions are changed. Check, restrict, or compel to avoid or perform some action. •Use redundancies such as double-checking someone’s work. •Avoid reliance on memory by using tools such as checklists. •Take advantage of habits and patterns to perform consistently (habit) and in a recognizable way (pattern). •Promote effective team functioning (e.g., teamwork and communication). •Automate and use technology carefully.91 High Reliability Healthcare organizations and systems are working toward becoming highly reliable. As Gordon et al.92 pointed out, to p. 94 p. 95 become a high-reliability ­industry healthcare “needs a radical cultural transformation, like the one that has taken place in aviation over the past thirty years. . . . If aviation could do it, health care can too.”92(p7) Adopting high-reliability principles and practices helps the healthcare organization strive toward a near-zero-defect culture. ­Reason45 stated: “Perhaps the most important distinguishing feature of high reliability organizations is their collective preoccupation with the possibility of failure. They expect to make errors and train their workforce to recognize and recover them.”45(p770) HROs are “organizations with systems in place that are exceptionally consistent in accomplishing their goals and avoiding catastrophic errors.”93,94(p298) Five key concepts frame the HRO. They include the following: 1.Sensitivity to operations. Preserving constant awareness and vigilance by leaders and staff about the state of the systems and processes affecting patient care. This awareness is central to noting risks and preventing them. 2.Reluctance to simplify. Simple processes are good, but simplistic explanations for why things work or fail are risky.

Simple processes are good, but simplistic explanations for why things work or fail are risky. Avoiding overly simple explanations of failure (unqualified staff, inadequate training, communication failure, etc.) is essential to understand the true reasons patients are placed at risk. 3.Preoccupation with failure. When near misses occur, these are viewed as evidence of systems to improve for reduction of potential harm to patients. Rather than viewing near misses as proof the system has effective safeguards, they are viewed as symptomatic of areas in need of more attention. 4.Deference to expertise. If leaders and supervisors are not willing to listen and respond to the insights of staff who know how processes work and the risks patients face, high reliability in the organization’s safety culture may not be possible. 5.Resilience. Leaders and staff need to be trained and prepared to know how to respond when system failures do occur.95(p1) These concepts lead to mindfulness, an important component of reliability, which keep HROs at a high level of vigilance.95(p7) Chassin and Loeb96(p481) propose organizations use robust process improvement, “a combination of Lean, Six Sigma, and change management” as a new set of tools to achieve high reliability and maintain patient safety. These can achieve outcomes such as decreased morbidity and mortality through the application of replicable and scalable patient safety interventions. Many organizations now use the Lean practice of system redesign with a focus on the human factors in their patient safety programs. See Performance and Process Improvement for more information on Lean and Six Sigma, and Organizational Leadership for more information on change management. Weick and Sutcliffe97,98 explain the success of an HRO—by acting mindfully, an HRO organizes itself so the unexpected is noticed and stopped from advancing. Five principles are found to impact HRO performance and responsiveness: 1.Preoccupation with failure. Attention on close calls and near misses (“being lucky vs being good”); focus more on failures rather than successes. 2.Reluctance to simplify interpretations. Solid “root cause” analysis practices. 3.Sensitivity to operations. Situational awareness and carefully designed change management processes. 4.Commitment to resilience.

Using these principles, the healthcare quality professional can work with others in the organization to create a mindful infrastructure that prevents harm from happening, reduces the damage produced by unexpected events, and promotes reliable performance. Marx has been working with high reliability in the context of a just culture for over 20 years and offered that “it is through the lessons of our everyday errors that we can design our work environment.”81(p3) High reliability is dependent on making good choices and becoming less error prone and more error tolerant. Marx works from a model-based approach to managing risk proactive or anticipatory) instead of an event-driven approach (reactive). The focus on highly reliable outcomes derives from a core set of principles99 that include the following: •Zero is not possible. •There is no such thing as an HRO; there are only organizations that are highly reliable around those things they value. •Humans are not inherently rule followers—they are threat and hazards avoiders. •There is a preoccupation with risk. Faulty equipment and fallible human beings can still produce great results. •Strive to be three human errors away from harm with robust system design. •It is about system design and choices and managing the right things. •Doing less is often the better path—adopt smart designs that are often less extensive. An example of system design and redesign is the Lean Healthcare program developed and deployed by Hagg et al.100 for different initiatives. The program strategy enabled the robust implementation of quality and performance improvement initiatives including clinical practice bundles. See FIGURE 2-4 for techniques and methodologies used. The program applied Lean and systems engineering methodologies and was p. 95 p. 96 structured to sustain improvements in process effectiveness and patient outcomes. The idea is to build sustainable programs as when change is frequent or not sustained, the result is often accompanied by increased staff fatigue, a more stressful work environment, and increased costs.100(p1) Different projects were successfully implemented that affected patient safety such as emergency department patient flow, surgical flow, medication delivery process redesign, ICU length of stay reduction (including ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]/­glycemic control bundles), central line and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus bundles,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_45"}}],["133",{"pageContent":"emergency department patient flow, surgical flow, medication delivery process redesign, ICU length of stay reduction (including ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]/­glycemic control bundles), central line and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus bundles, and patient fall reduction.

Another example of system design for infection prevention and control is the “Journey to Zero” that includes innovative strategies to eradicate HAIs through a process of laying the foundation (sizing the burden), crafting a multipronged strategy (establishing frontline awareness and minimizing pathogen opportunity), and ensuring sustainable success and promoting long-term gains.14(pp18–19) Hand hygiene is an example of where the principles of high reliability bring promise. To get to zero HAIs, the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare developed a Hand Hygiene Targeted Solutions Tool to manage change so it can be sustained using principles of leadership, safety culture, and performance improvement.101 Many organizations use this tool to increase hand hygiene. Risk Management In the 1970s, RM was the initial reaction to continually increasing litigation. However, as litigation continued to rise, RM assumed a more proactive role in reducing the incidents of unsafe care. Today, healthcare organizations focus on maintaining good and defined standards of practice to identify hazards posing risks to patients, assess the risks associated with healthcare hazards against the intended benefit, and eliminate or reduce risks to patients.102 TABLE 2-6 summarizes how approaches and processes of healthcare risk management (HRM) have evolved.

Paper occurrence form required for reporting. Variety of methods to report: paper form, electronic form, telephone call, anonymous reporting, person-to-person reporting. Investigate only the serious occurrences. Encourage reporting of “near misses,” and investigate and discuss the potential root causes for any incident, regardless of severity. Interview staff one-on-one when there is an adverse incident. Hold root cause analysis meetings with the entire team of caregivers. Identify human and system factors that contributed to the event. Information from investigation kept confidential. Develop corrective action, share with patient safety committee and others in the organization who need to know. Blame and train. Perform a criticality analysis and determine the root cause of the “near miss” or the adverse occurrence. Identify human and system factors. Talk to the patient or patient’s family only if necessary and be vague about findings. Advise physician or other caregiver to speak directly with the patient and/or family. Talk with them about any unexpected outcomes and errors. Share steps taken to make environment safe for next patient. Work with department involved to develop corrective action. Work with team and organization’s leadership to develop a patient safety improvement plan. Assume that action is taken to correct the problem that occurred, notice only when it happens again that no action was taken. Monitor the patient safety improvement plan to determine that changes are initiated and that the changes made a difference. Keep patients in the dark about risk management and occurrence reporting. Establish ongoing patient safety education; publish patient safety bulletins that address specific patient safety issues and the organization’s approach to managing them; provide opportunity for patients to identify methods of improving patient safety and to share them with administration; disclose errors.

Whereas the traditional evolution demonstrates a strong focus on clinical HRM, the concept of enterprise risk management is becoming more popular in expanding the focus of risks that affect the entire organization, not just clinical operations. In 2010, Carroll noted that “Enterprise risk management (ERM) is a comprehensive business decision-making process instituted and supported by the healthcare organization’s board, executive management, and medical staff leadership. ERM recognizes the synergistic effect of risks across the continuum of care, and has as its goals to reduce uncertainty and process variability, promote patient safety and maximize the return on investment through asset preservation, and the recognition of actionable risk opportunities.”103(p585) The major categories of risk in ERM include the following: •Strategic: Brand and reputational risks associated with business strategy, changing priorities, and competition; •Financial: Risks that affect the profitability, cash flow access to capital, or financial ratings; •Legal and regulatory: Risks associated with licensure, accreditation, product liability, and intellectual property issues; •Operational: Risks related to the business operation that may result from failed processes, people, or systems; •Human capital: Risks associated with a tight labor market, including selection, retention, and compensation; •Technology: Risks associated with machines, equipment, devices, hardware, and software; and p. 96 p. 97 •Hazard: risks related to physical loss of assets, often associated with natural hazards such as earthquakes, wildfire, cyclonic storms, flood, and drought. In 2014, Carroll furthered the definition of ERM in healthcare as a “comprehensive framework for making RM decisions which maximize value protection and creation by managing risk and uncertainty and their connection to total value.”104(p5) ERM includes components of culture, strategy, objectives, appetite/tolerance, structure and plans, and oversight: •Culture: A culture supporting ERM, including programs such as HROs, Crew Resource Management, Just Culture, and Mindfulness. •Strategy: Management’s game plan for strengthening enterprise performance, with an organizational strategy linked to vision, mission, goals and objectives. •Objectives: Ensuring ERM objectives are SMART—specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. •Appetite/Tolerance: Determining the desired level of risk the organization will take vis-","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_48"}}],["136",{"pageContent":", mission, goals and objectives. •Objectives: Ensuring ERM objectives are SMART—specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. •Appetite/Tolerance: Determining the desired level of risk the organization will take vis-à-vis its mission and threshold or qualitative range of risks taken in pursuit of the organization’s strategy (i.e., tolerance). •Structure and Plans: Organization-wide communication and education plans describe key roles and committee structures, employee engagement strategies, techniques to update employees on the progress of ERM initiatives, p. 97 p. 98 key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs), and scenarios highlighting the value of ERM to the organization. •Oversight: Acknowledging the responsibility of the Governing Body for ERM oversight; leadership ensures the Governing Body is regularly apprised of: progress on risk strategies, status of KPIs and KRIs, emerging risks and recommendations for new projects.104(pp6–8) Risk and Quality Effective strategies for proactively reducing errors and ensuring patient safety require an integrated and coordinated approach to synthesizing knowledge and experience. Staff members are encouraged to learn about errors and permit internal reporting of information without blame. There are interdependencies and intersections between healthcare quality and RM. Healthcare quality professionals work in tandem with enterprise RM to •improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization’s processes and operations through consistent identification of risks (threats) to the enterprise; •identify, evaluate, and prioritize areas of risk affecting the operations of the organization; •assess whether the identified risks are caused by internal (controllable) or external (uncontrollable) factors; •develop and propose comprehensive strategies to minimize risks; •establish action plans to address problems when identified; and •maintain a periodic evaluation of feedback to monitor the progress of strategies and actions. HRM can be defined as an “organized effort to identify, assess, and reduce, where appropriate, risk to patients, visitors, staff and organizational assets.”105(p3) The goal of HRM in any organization is to protect from financial losses, which may arise because of the risks to which it is exposed. A healthcare risk manager must consider such things as regulatory compliance, safety management, credentialing, client–provider relations, publicity and media coverage, and, most importantly, patient care.

In this way, HRM and patient safety are closely aligned. Key to ERM program management is the risk manager. This position is an important asset to the organization and is typically charged with functions related to risk identification, risk assessment and evaluation, and application of techniques to reduce risks. Duties vary widely by organization, but the basic ERM functions are as follows: •Risk identification, assessment, planning, mitigation, and evaluation; •Maintenance and monitoring of effective incident reporting and occurrence screen programs; •Clinical and administrative responsibilities, such as regulatory compliance, policy review, credentialing, contract review, internal and external reporting, and education; •Collaboration and communication with environmental safety officer, patient safety officer, and quality officer (although not optimal, in some organizations these are the same position); •Collaboration with the financial officer on insurance and other risk financing methods; and •Collaboration and communication with legal representatives for claims management. The risk manager is often charged with developing and deploying the ERM plan to align patient safety efforts so RM activities are not siloed. It is helpful for risk managers to also have some experience and knowledge in these areas: clinical knowledge because they must review care and provide guidance to clinical providers of care; knowledge of healthcare law and thorough understanding of the legal system because review is necessary of defense counsel work and legal documents; knowledge about the insurance industry because risk managers help make decisions about various insurance coverages, such as hospital professional liability, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Risk Management Plan. A healthcare organization typically has a formal, written plan explaining its ERM philosophy. Often the ERM plan is integrated with the quality and patient safety plan because the processes are interdependent. Important plan elements include purpose and board statement of support of ERM, scope of the program, authority, and confidentiality assertions, data collection and reporting mechanisms (both internal and external) and integration with quality management and program effectiveness reviews. Within the plan, prevention of risk is often managed by •contract review •internal and external reporting processes •education of staff and providers •policy review to protect the organization •informed consent.

An important aspect of enterprise RM is management of claims. TABLE 2-7 lists the types of professional liability sources often considered in determining the validity of a claim. Table 2-7 Professional Liability Sources Corporate liability Based on recognition that the organization owes a duty to the patients it serves Vicarious liability Indirect responsibility for the acts of another person; respondeat superior, which holds the employer responsible for the wrongful acts of its employees Ostensible agency Generally an organization is not liable for injuries sustained by patients because of the actions of an independent contractor. However, the extension of respondeat superior to the doctrine of the ostensible agency may extend liability exposure to the organization for acts of nonemployed, independent contractor physicians where no employer–employee relationship exists. Res ipsa loquitur Allows a patient to prove his or her case without needing to establish the standard of care in which there is clear and obvious negligence p. 98 p. 99 Risk Assessment Organizations can establish mechanisms for reviewing potential incidents of risk and safety concern. All members of the workforce are responsible for identifying, reporting, and documenting RM and potential quality-of-care problems that influence patient safety. Variance or incident reporting is an important component of any patient safety program. Healthcare quality professionals assist organizations in developing and maintaining IRS. AHRQ106 describes four attributes of voluntary patient safety event reporting systems: 1.Institution must have a supportive environment for event reporting to protect the privacy of staff who report occurrences. 2.Reports are received from a broad range of personnel. 3.Summaries of reported events must be disseminated in a timely fashion. 4.A structured mechanism must be in place for reviewing reports and developing action plans.106(¶2) Only a small portion of healthcare errors (10% to 20%) is reported. Of the errors reported, 90% to 95% result in no harm to the patient.107 A report of the DHHS Office Inspector General108 found “most incidents of patient harm were not being reported.

The AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture showed only 45% of staff feel their mistakes and event reports are not held against them and mistakes are not kept in their personnel file110; this rate has been consistently low since 2012 (see TABLE 2-8).

Both formal and informal methods are used, and the risks may be internal or external to the organization. Approaches used include retrospective, concurrent, pre-interventional, and prospective. Approaches in risk identification are aimed to identify the root causes of risks for things that do go wrong (e.g., RCA) and possible modes by which these functions might fail to perform (e.g., FMEA). It may be “easier to identify all the factors that are critical to success, and then work backward to identify the things that can go wrong with each one.”111(p24) Once the risks have been identified, the next step is to conduct a risk assessment to quantify the magnitude or severity of the risks, the exposure through possible results, frequency of occurrence, probability of the occurrence, and time to act. Through this analysis, the organization can determine RM techniques that can be applied to the exposures to mitigate loss, select the best RM technique for the situation, prioritize actions, identify resources needed, identify risk control and risk financing methods, implement the techniques, monitor the effectiveness of the technique, and trend and analyze results.

Disclosure of Errors Disclosing errors to patients and families is becoming more common practice in healthcare organizations across the country, especially in the aftermath of the Josie King incident in Maryland. Disclosure as an important part of error discovery in contrast to tactics of the past, which sprang from fear and blame.74 A just culture supports the disclosure of successes and failures.

This reporting system encourages every clinician to report situations in which patients are at risk and potentially lifesaving actions are warranted.113 Patient Safety Tools Professionals who lead patient safety programs and initiatives know the importance of using the most current evidence-based information to inform design and implementation efforts. Effective tools and strategies for implementation support the advances and improvement understanding of risk factors associated with the different aspects of healthcare affecting the safe delivery of healthcare—health IT, adverse events reporting, risk identification, infection prevention and control, medication safety, physical plant, and environment of care to name a few. Using evidence-based tools can promote patient-centered care and accelerate positive changes in the patient safety culture. For example, Plan–Do–Study–Act may help implement sustainable improvement by using small tests of change. See Performance and Process Improvement and Health Data Analytics for more information about tools for evaluating and improving quality and safety. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis A failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) can be used to develop safety program activities and provide continuous readiness for external surveys. It is a way for staff to be p. 100 p. 101 p. 101 p. 102 proactive in their pursuit of quality and safety versus to being reactive; to imagine what could go wrong and correct any risk factors before errors occur. FMEA includes review of the following: •Steps in the process •Failure modes (What could go wrong?) •Failure causes (Why would the failure happen?) •Failure effects (What would be the consequences of each failure?).91(¶1) FMEA and Healthcare FMEA are fully described in detail in Performance and Process Improvement. Root Cause Analysis Organizations use RCA to determine the cause of a variation in a process. Human, environmental, equipment, policy, and leadership system factors are explored in the analysis. The OPSC has developed an exceptional RCA Toolkit.114 It provides a framework for investigating adverse incidents and can be applied in any healthcare setting.

The National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF) developed a definitive guide on conducting RCAs.115 These guidelines have been endorsed by TJC and other public and private patient safety organizations. The guide provides teams with effective techniques to conduct comprehensive systematic reviews to develop strong and sustainable actions to prevent future occurrence. See FIGURE 2-5 for the NPSF Root Cause Analysis and Action (RCA2) Process. Figure 2-5 Root cause analysis and action (RCA2) process.

The most important aspect of a Red Rule is to empower all workers to speak up when a rule is not being followed and to stop the line, regardless of their position in the organization.118,119 When properly implemented, Red Rules foster a culture of safety because frontline workers will know they can stop the line when they notice potential hazards. The most important aspect of a Red Rule is its ability to “empower any worker to speak up when the rule is not being followed and to stop the line, regardless of rank or seniority.”119(p2) ISMP119 outlines what differentiates a Red Rule from other crucial rules such as policies and procedures: •It must be possible and desirable for everyone to follow a Red Rule every time in a process under all circumstances (Red Rules do not contain verbiage such as “except when…” or “each breach will be assessed for appropriateness”). •Anyone who notices the breach","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_59"}}],["147",{"pageContent":"and desirable for everyone to follow a Red Rule every time in a process under all circumstances (Red Rules do not contain verbiage such as “except when…” or “each breach will be assessed for appropriateness”). •Anyone who notices the breach of the Rule has the authority and responsibility to stop further progress of patient care while protecting the patient or healthcare worker from harm. •Managers and other leaders (including the board of trustees) always support the work stoppage, immediate rectification of the problem, and addressing the underlying reason for breaking the rule. •People breaching the Red Rule are given an opportunity to support their behavioral choices and are then judged fairly based on the reasons for breaking the rule, regardless of rank and experience. •There are few Red Rules, and they must be well understood and memorable.(119¶7) Healthcare scenarios for which Red Rules can be beneficial include patient identification (using two identifiers before administering tests of any kind), sponge-count reconciliation, timeouts before an invasive procedure, timely alarm response, and correct labeling of specimens. Newer to healthcare quality and safety, there is a mixed reception of Red Rules. Red Rules are part of a just culture although the way they are deployed could impact how they are received by affected personnel. There are circumstances where they are experienced as blaming and punitive, which is not aligned with a just culture. The way that Red Rules are deployed may not support trust and transparency. Jones and O’Connor120 examined four measures of patient safety culture among two groups of hospitals that completed the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture and compared hospitals that did or did not implement Red Rules as a patient safety strategy. The four measures were (1) staff perceptions of safety; (2) frequency of events reported; (3) number of events reported; and (4) staff perceptions of no punitive response. The study found that there were no differences in the four measures between those hospitals who used Red Rules and those who did not. The authors did suggest that Red Rules can be effective as part of a comprehensive strategy to improve patient safety when used within a commitment-based management style. Red Rules can be used as a communication tool to support staff in following safety rules rather than a disciplinary action. If misused or poorly supported, they will not be effective and may even introduce patient risks if systems and processes are not in place to facilitate adherence to the Red Rule.118 Safety Checklists A checklist is an algorithmic, evidence-based listing of actions to","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_60"}}],["148",{"pageContent":"misused or poorly supported, they will not be effective and may even introduce patient risks if systems and processes are not in place to facilitate adherence to the Red Rule.118 Safety Checklists A checklist is an algorithmic, evidence-based listing of actions to be performed with the goal of “no step forgotten.” Grounded in human factors engineering, checklists can shape the organizational and systematic thinking and behaviors in healthcare delivery. Checklists are found to •improve communication, •strengthen adherence with guidelines, •improve human factors, •reduce the incidence of adverse events, and •decrease mortality and morbidity.121 Patient safety checklists “allow complex pathways of care to function with high reliability by giving users the opportunity to pause and take stock of their actions before proceeding to the next step.”122(¶1) Checklists can be developed for internal processes (surgical checklist) or can be consumer-­focused.123 Surgical checklists are the most commonly used, but other checklists are developed for safe childbirth, trauma care, and Pandemic H1N1122 and other patient safety events, such as blood clots and central line–associated blood stream infections. Recently, the CDC124 released its Checklist for Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs, which is recommended for facilities to systematically assess the core key elements, actions to ensure optimal antibiotic prescribing, and limiting the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Checklists are helpful in preparing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating workforce and environmental safety. Healthcare services can be directly or indirectly provided to individuals in a variety of settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, emergency departments, home health, and skilled nursing facilities). There are many health and safety hazards that workers face across the different settings including blood-borne pathogens, potential drug exposures, respiratory hazards, ergonomic hazards, and workplace violence. There are accreditation standards, regulations and state, federal and local laws governing workplace safety. Checklists can support an organization’s workforce and environmental safety efforts.

All rights reserved.) p. 106 p. 107 The benefit of using checklists was cemented with the publication of the “Keystone Initiative” findings by Pronovost in the New England Journal of Medicine. This project focused on the reduction of catheter-related bloodstream infection using a checklist to ensure adherence to infection-control practices—handwashing, using full-barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site if possible, and removing unnecessary catheters. This project garnered success by reducing and sustaining rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection that was maintained throughout the 18-month study period.125 Gawande126,127 advanced the thinking about the use of checklists in healthcare. The regimentation offered by checklists can reduce risk and save lives in complex situations. Healthcare is highly specialized. Couple complexity with specialization, the routine might be overlooked and steps skipped in processes. Consistent use and improvement of checklists may offer healthcare providers a tool to focus less of their efforts on the routine and more on the difficult. There is resistance to the adoption of checklists in healthcare. Based on work by Treadwell, Lucas and Tsou,128 barriers to implementation can fall into these categories: 1.Confusion regarding how to properly use the checklist, efficient workflow, access to resources, and individual beliefs and attitudes. 2.Workflow problems such as extra time, duplication of safety checks already routinely performed, and access to resources required to fulfill the checklist. 3.Individual attitudes of staff toward the checklist such as resistance to changing habits and interpersonal hierarchy (e.g., operating room). 4.Legal responsibility and RM.

Evaluating and Improving Patient Safety Healthcare quality professionals work collaboratively with others to improve compliance with standards set forth by TJC National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs), Leapfrog Safe Practices, NQF-endorsed measures, and federal government-vetted measures (e.g., AHRQ, National Health Safety Network). Standards for patient safety practices include recommendations to improve accuracy in patient identification, effectiveness of communication among caregivers, precautions when using high-alert medications, and surgery safeguards.129 Proposed solutions to improving patient safety range from making electronic health information readily available to providers and consumers to inviting patients to make decisions collaboratively with their care providers.28,130 When thinking about meeting or exceeding standards, part of the healthcare quality professional’s work is to identify what interventions to use and their effects—some small things can lead to big and sustainable change. There are important resources to consider, such as systems for collecting reliable and valid data, selecting measures that provide the information for evaluation, and focusing on relevant high-volume problem prone areas such as safe medication practices. As healthcare quality professionals aim to improve safety for the patient, organization, or system of care, they might consider the following for launching routine monitoring and evaluation of activities and specific projects: •Establishing the plan to evaluate the actual impact on health outcomes, quality of care, and patient safety due to the effort (patient, healthcare personnel, clinical workflow, other relevant indicators); •Feasibility, usability, and possibilities when identifying the target population and/or problem to be addressed; •Clearly defining the quantifiable impact of the effort (e.g., number of incidents, rates of occurrence) and who is affected (e.g., patients, clinicians, department, unit); •Determining appropriate tools to use (e.g., RCA, FMEA, other Lean tools); and •Identifying mechanisms to share results and efforts resulting in improved safety (e.g., board reports, enterprise-wide communications, patient materials). As part of developing the patient safety plan, healthcare organizations can conduct a thorough analysis of where patients and healthcare personnel are at risk for errors.

Patient safety plans are often integrated in quality or performance improvement program plans. These are five components of an effective patient safety system: 1.monitoring of progress and maintenance of vigilance, 2.knowledge of the epidemiology of patient safety risks and hazards, 3.development of effective practices and tools, 4.building infrastructure for effective practices, and 5.achieving broader adoption of effective practices.129(p4) Two exemplars shown here are University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System and Intermountain p. 107 p. 108 Healthcare. The UCLA Health System’s Performance Improvement & Patient Safety Plan goals include the following: •Achieve a patient safety conscious environment throughout the facility. •Improve the reporting of medical errors by establishing a policy focusing on corrective actions through staff education for those reporting their errors, rather than punitive or disciplinary actions. •Implement confidential electronic event reporting process that includes documentation of follow-up and reporting processes. •Expand the implementation of evidence-based practices. •Monitor hospital-wide indicators for established areas of focus. •Reduce the number of medication errors. •Monitor patient safety indicators related to an area’s specific “Scope of Service.” •Conduct a proactive risk assessment utilizing the FMEA methodology. •Monitor and improve areas identified through patient satisfaction surveys.131(p4) Intermountain Healthcare’s Quality & Patient Safety Plan goals include the following: •Attain optimal patient outcomes and patient and family experience. •Support an engaged and safe workforce. •Enhance appropriate utilization. •Minimize risks and hazards of care. •Develop and share best practices.132(p6) When deploying the plan, various statistical process control and quality improvement tools can be used in patient safety initiatives.

Health Information Health IT holds the promise of making healthcare services safer and offers clinical decision support through electronic health records (EHR). If health IT is to work, the healthcare consumer must be at the center of the healthcare system and be empowered with their personal healthcare data. Often these questions are asked. Is health IT easy to use? How quickly does it process information? How functional is it? How can it help me? If health IT is to be effective in the care setting, it needs to be integrated with the patient and clinical workflow and aligned with available resources and the expectations of the end users. Leadership plays a critical role in the adoption of health IT (EHRs, personal health records, and e-prescribing systems) and ensuring risks associated with heath IT are avoided altogether or mitigated. TJC provides a framework for maintaining a culture of safety vis-à-vis health IT by 1.collective mindfulness focused on identifying, reporting, analyzing, and reducing health IT-related hazardous conditions, close calls, or errors; 2.comprehensive and systematic analysis of each adverse event causing harm to determine if health IT contributed to the event in any way; and 3.shared involvement and responsibility for the safety of health IT among the healthcare organization, clinicians, and vendors/developers.133(pp2–3) EHRs typically include four core components: electronic clinical documentation, results reporting and management, e-prescribing, and clinical decision support. Over time, other functionalities such as barcoding and patient engagement tools were added. Health IT and interoperable systems are requisites for healthcare delivery in the 21st century. In 2012, an IOM report examined the state of the art in system safety and opportunities to build safer systems and concluded as follows: •Safety is an emergent property of a larger system that accounts for not just the software but also how it is used by clinicians. •The “sociotechnical system” includes technology (software, hardware), people (clinicians, patients), processes (workflow), organization (capacity, decisions about how health IT is applied, incentives), and the external environment (regulations, public opinion). •Safer implementation and use of health IT is a complex, dynamic process","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_66"}}],["154",{"pageContent":"(clinicians, patients), processes (workflow), organization (capacity, decisions about how health IT is applied, incentives), and the external environment (regulations, public opinion). •Safer implementation and use of health IT is a complex, dynamic process that requires a shared responsibility between vendors and healthcare organizations. •Poor user-interface design, poor workflow, and complex data interfaces threaten patient safety. •Lack of system interoperability is a barrier to improving clinical decisions and patient safety. •Constant, ongoing commitment to safety—from acquisition to implementation and maintenance—is needed to achieve safer, more effective care.134(ppS2-S4) EHRs have the potential to capture data for purposes of patient safety performance and improvement. However, some say not enough evidence exists to support the link between the EHR and patient safety135 and may have unintended consequences as follows: •Workarounds and alarm fatigue such as “delayed response time to alarms, disabled alarms, volumes set to inaudible, parameters limits set to unsafe zones, or alarms paused p. 108 p. 109 without a thoughtful consideration of the warning message.”136(pE1) •Incorrect patient matching where some or all data retrieved via health information exchange (HIE) relate to a different (and incorrect) patient. Such errors can happen because of flawed matching algorithms used for HIE. •Data quality issues, such as incomplete patient data, duplicate patient records, or data entry errors, can propagate through HIE, increasing the potential for adverse safety events. •Loss of data integrity during transmission. For example, if the HIE process alters the meaning of the data or errors in translation that occur between different systems, reflecting differences in vocabularies. If the HIE degrades EHR or other system performance, critical delays in accessing HIE data can result.137 TABLE 2-11 provides potential benefits and safety concerns of IT components commonly used in healthcare.

Copyright 2012 by National Academies Press, with permission. As part of national efforts to improve the use of health IT, the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) was established. The NHIN is comprised of standards, services, and a trust fabric that enables the secure exchange of health information over the Internet. This critical part of the national health IT agenda is that health information follows the consumer, is available for clinical decision-making, and supports appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care to public health. A key component of the technology strategy is providing a common platform for HIE across diverse entities, within communities and across the country, helping to achieve the goals of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act.138(p4) Free, open source software was developed to support local and national efforts to provide HIE. This kind of information exchange is critical for community-wide patient safety efforts as the NHIN will •improve the coordination of care information among hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, pharmacies, and other providers; p. 109 p. 110 •ensure appropriate information is available at the time and place of care; •ensure consumer health information is secure and confidential; •give consumers new capabilities to manage and control their personal health records, as well as providing access to their health information from EHRs and other sources; •reduce risks from medical errors and support the delivery of appropriate, evidence-based medical care; and •lower healthcare costs resulting from inefficiencies, medical errors, and incomplete patient information.139 An exemplar of this strategy is the implementation of a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VLER program ensures an EHR for each veteran that is accessible, with consent, by public and private sector healthcare providers. The first pilot of this program occurred in San Diego, CA, between the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Kaiser Permanente.

As work is undertaken, consider the available tools to organize and support initiatives. For example, patient identification-related events present risk for patient care. The partnership for Health IT Patient Safety is a multi-stakeholder group working to identify how to optimize health IT for safer care. The partnership currently offers two toolkits—patient identification and cut and paste. The Health IT Safe Practices: The Safe Use of Health IT for Patient Identification toolkit offers a framework of eight safety practice recommendations using IDENTIFY—Include, Detect, Evaluate, Normalize, Tailor, Innovate, Follow-up, and Yield.142 This model is useful when looking at the independent and interacting effects of behaviors and technology.

Gathering and using real-time data will help the organization improve and protect patients from harm. Selected measures may relate to structure, process, outcomes, resource use, or composite of measure attributes. With the proliferation of reliable and valid safety measures, the healthcare quality professional can examine available measures and determine which will be the most meaningful to the organization’s internal and external stakeholders. There is no one single source for safety measures, so the healthcare quality professional can review available measures for the healthcare setting. The most logical place to start are measures from organizations that require certain measures for payment or accreditation. These measures may have been developed and validated by the sponsoring organization (e.g., NCQA and HEDIS) or are endorsed measures that are used by third-party payers or accreditation agencies (e.g., NQF). The following are possible sources of such measures. The Joint Commission. TJC, through its accreditation standards and other activities, strives to help organizations achieve zero patient harm. TJC standards require the organization gather and analyze the data generated through standardized monitoring. Results are used to inform the goals and objectives of care, treatment, or services, and the outcomes of care, treatment, or services provided to the population served by aggregating and analyzing the data gathered through the standardized monitoring effort. The agency assists healthcare organizations in collecting and reporting performance improvement and accountability data through ORYX and Core Measure Sets. The NPSGs are another way that TJC assists healthcare organizations and programs in the United States through accreditation surveys and continuous readiness. Currently, there are safety goals for ambulatory healthcare, behavioral healthcare, critical access hospitals, home care, hospitals, laboratories, nursing care centers, and office-based surgery.143 TABLE 2-12 describes examples of the current NPSGs for hospitals. Table 2-12 Examples of the National Patient Safety Goals Goal 1. Improve the accuracy of patient identification Example Use at least two patient identifiers to verify a patient’s identity upon admission or transfer to another hospital or other care setting and prior to the administration of care. Goal 2. Improve the effectiveness of communication among caregivers Example Report critical results of tests on a timely basis by defining who should receive the results; who should receive the results when the ordering provider is not available, what results require timely and reliable communication, when the results should be actively reported to the ordering provider with explicit timeframes, how to notify the responsible provider, and how to design, support,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_71"}}],["159",{"pageContent":"should receive the results when the ordering provider is not available, what results require timely and reliable communication, when the results should be actively reported to the ordering provider with explicit timeframes, how to notify the responsible provider, and how to design, support, and maintain the systems involved (Hanna et al., 2005). Goal 3. Improve the safety of using medications Example Maintain and communicate accurate patient medication information through medication reconciliation to avoid inadvertent inconsistencies across transitions in care by reviewing the patient’s complete medication regimen at the time of care transitions (e.g., admission, transfer, discharge) (AHRQ, 2015).

The Leapfrog Group’s safe practices informed the development of 34 NQF-endorsed safety practices. These hospital practices, if implemented, reduce harm in several areas. The practices comprise elements related to leadership, care needs, information transfer and communication, medication management, HAIs, and specific care processes. On the 2016 Leapfrog Hospital Survey, 1,266 hospitals reported on C-sections, 987 reported mortality rates for surgeries, and 1,702 reported their Never Events policy.144 National Quality Forum. As a leader in patient safety, NQF is recognized as a voluntary consensus standards-setting organization as defined by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. Since 2002, NQF assembled a portfolio of more than 600 NQF-endorsed measures in use by both the private and public sectors for public reporting and quality improvement. Most notably, NQF accomplished the following: •2003: Endorsed a set of 30 practices for universal use in applicable clinical care settings to reduce the risk of harm to consumers. •2006: Undertook an update of the original set and endorsed practices with significantly expanded specifications, supporting literature, and guidance for implementation. •2009: Endorsed practices were updated to address pediatric imaging, organ donation, caring for caregivers, glycemic control, and falls prevention. •2010: Added evidence to the existing practices, and more direction was given to healthcare professionals for implementation and patient and family engagement.157 NQF has endorsed over 100","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 2 - Patient Safety_73"}}],["161",{"pageContent":"donation, caring for caregivers, glycemic control, and falls prevention. •2010: Added evidence to the existing practices, and more direction was given to healthcare professionals for implementation and patient and family engagement.157 NQF has endorsed over 100 consensus standards with a focus on patient safety.79 The NQF’s consensus-setting efforts support the evaluation of patient safety using standardized performance measurement.

Evaluating the Culture of Safety How does an organization evaluate its progress and success in achieving a culture of safety? Safety culture is generally measured by patients and healthcare providers. Safety culture measures reflect teamwork training, executive walk rounds, and establishing unit-based safety teams. These have been associated with improvements in safety culture measures but have not yet linked to lower error rates. Other methods, such as “rapid response teams and structured communication methods such as SBAR, are being widely implemented to help address cultural issues such as rigid hierarchies and communication problems, but their effect on overall safety culture and error rates remains.”146 SBAR is an acronym for p. 113 p. 114 Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation, which is a standardized tool used in healthcare settings to facilitate communication. Surveys are the most common approach to evaluating the safety climate or safety culture.

For the purposes of reporting on NQF Safe Practice 2: Culture Measurement, Feedback, and Intervention, hospitals must conduct a culture of safety survey of their employees within the past 24 months. The units surveyed must account for at least 50% of the aggregated care delivered to patients within the facility, and includes the high patient safety risk units or departments using a nationally recognized tool that has demonstrated validity, consistency, and reliability. When selecting a survey tool for the organization, the healthcare quality professional should consider the following: •Alignment of survey with setting where survey will be administered. •Nationally recognized survey that is determined valid and reliable. •Survey supported by evidence from peer-reviewed literature. •Respondent burden is minimized. •Results offer information that is actionable. •Benchmarking data are available.147–149 Validated surveys will have well-detailed methodology to assure a successful survey administration. Healthcare quality professionals should consider using a third-party vendor for the survey administration—the vendor can be a safe intermediary for data collection, ensure anonymity of respondents, and work with the organization to achieve higher response rates. Descriptions of more commonly used assessment and survey tools follow. The Oro 2.0 High Reliability Organizational Assessment. TJC Center for Transforming Health Care Oro 2.0 High Reliability Organizational Assessment consists of a series of questions for senior leaders to reflect upon and come to consensus on the organization’s current high-reliability status. The Assessment looks at the organization’s level of maturity and incorporates multiple domains across 14 areas of performance such as leadership commitment to achieving zero patient harm, how the safety culture is functioning, and the deployment of performance improvement tools. Per the Center, the Oro 2.0 accomplishes the following: •Serves as a guiding force for transformation. •Provides crucial information about strengths, opportunities, and potential investment strategies for achieving high performance. •Can be repeated to assess the organization’s progress in its high-reliability journey over time.150 All staff at accredited hospitals and critical access hospitals can access ORO 2.0 through the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare’s website, or can be granted access through Joint Commission Connect.

Physician Practice Patient Safety Assessment. When the IOM published Crossing the Quality Chasm in 2001, the extent of preventable medical errors was far reaching.21 Many initiatives focus on inpatient care and fewer focus on other settings such as ambulatory or nursing home care. The Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET)—in partnership with the AHA, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), and the Medical Group Management Association and its certifying body, the American College of Medical Practice Executives—developed the Physician Practice Patient Safety Assessment (PPPSA) for the medical practice setting.151 The PPPSA is an interactive self-assessment tool for evaluating medication safety, handoffs and transitions, surgery and invasive procedures, personnel qualifications and competency, practice management and culture, and patient education and communication. Healthcare quality professionals in ambulatory settings can use the PPPSA to •gain specific ideas to improve patient safety, •compare data to aggregate results for similar practices, •enhance team’s awareness of patient safety issues, •heighten provider awareness of characteristics that make a practice safer, •create a new reference point and baseline to enhance and support patient safety, and •document successes and track progress.152 University of Texas Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. This Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) measures caregiver attitudes about six patient safety-related domains, allows organizations to compare themselves to others, prompt interventions to improve safety attitudes, and measure the effectiveness of these interventions. The SAQ domain scales are teamwork climate, job satisfaction, perceptions of management, safety climate, working conditions, and stress recognition.148,153 An organization can use the tool to gather baseline data and measure the effectiveness of change and the adoption of patient safety practices. Patient Safety Climate in Healthcare Organizations. The Patient Safety Climate in Healthcare Organizations survey is designed to assess the healthcare workforce’s perception about the culture of safety in their organization. It assesses different aspects of safety including contributions to safety climate from the hospital, work unit, interpersonal and other. Contributing factors are measured including engagement, resources, emphasis on patient safety, unit support, p. 114 p. 115 unit-level factors (e.g., safety norms, recognition, support, and collective learning).

As part of its goal to support a culture of patient safety and quality improvement in the nation’s healthcare system, AHRQ developed its patient safety culture assessment tools for healthcare. In 2004, AHRQ developed and distributed a valid and reliable safety culture survey, the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture,155 to help hospitals, nursing homes, and ambulatory outpatient medical offices evaluate the culture of safety in their institutions. In 2008, AHRQ released its first benchmarking report based upon an analysis of data from 400 voluntary participating hospitals. Healthcare organizations can use these surveys to track changes in patient safety over time and evaluate the effects of patient safety interventions.34 The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture: 2016 User Comparative Database Report is a compilation of the most recent survey findings. Based on data provided voluntarily by hospitals, the report provides results hospitals can use as benchmarks to establish a culture of safety in comparison to similar hospitals or hospital units. The survey evaluates patient safety issues, medical errors, and event reporting. It includes 42 items that measure 12 areas, or composites, of patient safety culture. Each of the 12 composites or areas and their definitions are described in TABLE 2-14.

Further, it is estimated that it costs the US $289 billion per year for medication non-adherence.157 The patient safety culture has its foundation an atmosphere devoid of blame. An organization uses systematic ways to welcome the reporting of medication errors. Because 85% of errors are the result of system failures and traditionally only 15% are due to human error, the exploration of systems issues is primary to identifying a root cause of error.88 Both public and private sector organizations that have worked tirelessly to reduce medication errors include the ISMP, ECRI Institute, and the FDA. Through a consensus process, NQF endorsed the adoption of safe practices related to medication administration (TABLE 2-16). Other organizations such as the Leapfrog Group have shown support by their endorsements. To improve patient safety and hold the gains, healthcare organizations conduct a thorough analysis of where and how patients are at risk for potential medical errors and hardwire systems and processes to prevent them. Leadership style and climate have also been found to affect medication practices so the routine administration of culture of safety surveys may prove beneficial to identify opportunities for improvement at the organization and unit levels.158 Table 2-16 Safe Practices Related to Medication Administration Safe Practice 13: Order Read-back and Abbreviations Incorporate within the organization a safe, effective communication strategy, structures, and systems to include the following: •For verbal or telephone orders or for telephonic reporting of critical test results, verify the complete order or test result by having the person who is receiving the information record and “read back” the complete order or test result. •Standardize a list of “Do Not Use” abbreviations, acronyms, symbols, and dose designations that cannot be used throughout the organization. Safe Practice 16: Safe Adoption of Computerized Prescriber Order Entry •Implement a computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE) system built upon the requisite foundation of reengineered evidence-based care, an assurance of healthcare organization staff and independent practitioner readiness, and an integrated information technology infrastructure.

Technology Solutions Various technological solutions are proposed to enhance patient safety programs. A patient safety solution is defined as “any system design or intervention that has demonstrated p. 116 p. 117 the ability to prevent or mitigate patient harm stemming from the processes of health care.”159(p2) The premise of these solutions is that if processes are standardized and the potential for medical error is reduced by the automation of processes, errors will be mitigated. Clancy33 proposed a formula for healthcare improvement comprised of four health IT elements: (1) connect health records, (2) build smart systems, (3) put the patient at the center of care, and (4) put prevention at the center of treatment.

Patient Safety and the Learning Organization It is imperative that a continuous, dynamic learning healthcare system is achieved. This system is one that “provides the best care at lower cost: (1) managing rapidly increasing complexity; (2) achieving greater value in health care; and (3) capturing opportunities from technology, industry, and policy.”160(p8) How can this be achieved by a learning organization? The infrastructure of a learning organization embraces lifelong learning as a value and opportunities are continually provided for capacity building, developing core competencies, and seeking patient safety innovations. This includes cultivating good judgment and having the opportunity to use it. A learning organization embraces team learning, shared vision and goals, shared ways of thinking, individual commitment to lifelong learning, and systems thinking.161 Greater attention is paid to learning that fosters more rapid progress in patient safety, increases organizational capabilities, strengthens a culture of safety, fixes process problems that contribute to patient harm, and produces higher reliability.162 Creating the infrastructure for learning can be accomplished in many ways. As summarized by the ISMP,163 these are suggested steps for creating an infrastructure for learning that were informed by Conway’s work (2008).

As summarized by the ISMP,163 these are suggested steps for creating an infrastructure for learning that were informed by Conway’s work (2008). These include the following: •Identifying reliable sources of information about errors and risks •Establishing a systematic way to review external information about errors and risk •Bringing outside points of view into an organization from the literature or experts •Leveraging the learning of other organizations that had high-profile errors (e.g., contributing factors, how the error was addressed) •Integrating learning into existing processes in the organization (e.g., safety committee, board reports, unit-level quality teams). The healthcare quality professional can work with others in the organization to build a sustainable infrastructure that includes a multifaceted learning and organizational development plan for patient safety that is appropriate for the healthcare setting and is reflective of the development needs of personnel. The plan should be competency-based where individual and team clinical and interpersonal skill development will result in performance excellence for safety processes and outcomes. The plan can be supported by evidence-based publications and materials available from p. 117 p. 118 national and international organizations who already have developed curricula for teaching patient safety. In 2017, IHI and Safe & Reliable Healthcare released their white paper that talked about the importance of continuous reflection to assess performance. Learning systems that support reflection work to “identify defects and act on them; they reward proactivity rather than reactivity. Learning and a healthy culture reinforce one another by identifying and resolving clinical, cultural, and operational defects. By effectively applying improvement science, organizations can learn their way into many of the cultural components of the framework.”164 The intersections between culture and learning in this framework are shown in FIGURE 2-8.

Estimates show that in developed countries as many as one in 10 patients is harmed while receiving hospital care. The harm can be caused by a range of errors or adverse events. 3.Hospital infections affect 14 out of every 100 patients admitted. Of every 100 hospitalized patients at any given time, 7 in developed and 10 in developing countries will acquire healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Hundreds of millions of patients are affected worldwide each year. Simple and low-cost infection prevention and control measures, such as appropriate hand hygiene, can reduce the frequency of HAIs by more than 50%. 4.Most people lack access to appropriate medical devices. There are an estimated 1.5 million different medical devices and over 10,000 types of devices available worldwide. The majority of the world’s population is denied adequate access to safe and appropriate medical devices within their health systems. More than half of low- and lower middle-income countries do not have a national health technology policy which could ensure the effective use of resources through proper planning, assessment, acquisition and management of medical devices. 5.Unsafe injections decreased by 88% from 2000 to 2010. Key injection safety indicators measured in 2010 show that important progress has been made in the reuse rate of injection devices (5.5% in 2010), while modest gains were made through the reduction of the number of injections per person per year (2.88 in 2010). 6.Delivery of safe surgery requires a teamwork approach. An estimated 234 million surgical operations are performed globally every year. Surgical care is associated with a considerable risk of complications. Surgical care errors contribute to a significant burden of disease despite the fact that 50% of complications associated with surgical care are avoidable. 7.About 20–40% of all health spending is wasted due to poor quality care. Safety studies show that additional hospitalization, litigation costs, infections acquired in hospitals, disability, lost productivity and medical expenses cost some countries as much as US$19 billion annually.

Industries with a perceived higher risk such as the aviation and nuclear industries have a much better safety record than healthcare. There is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a traveler being harmed while in an aircraft. In comparison, there is a 1 in 300 chance of a patient being harmed during healthcare. 9.Patient and community engagement and empowerment are key. People’s experience and perspectives are valuable resources for identifying needs, measuring progress and evaluating outcomes. 10.Hospital partnerships can play a critical role. Hospital-to-hospital partnerships to improving patient safety and quality of care have been used for technical exchange between health workers for a number of decades. These partnerships provide a channel for bi-directional patient safety learning and the co-development of solutions in rapidly evolving global health systems.

Section Summary Healthcare professionals work diligently to identify and act on opportunities to improve safety. Attention is given to planning, development, implementation, and evaluation, as well as to continuous improvement. In summary, the following tenets are imperative for an effective patient safety program in any healthcare organization: •Healthcare leaders set the vision, mission, purpose, intention, and direction and provide the resources necessary to adopt evidence-based patient safety practices. •Error prevention and harm reduction are the shared responsibility of the board, executive leaders, medical leaders, healthcare personnel, and the patient and family. At every intersection, there is an opportunity to take different actions to mitigate risks and reduce harm. •Organizations create and maintain a fair and just culture by being mindful, taking actions to reduce preventable errors and mitigate risks, and emphasizing learning to support the workforce in eliminating or preventing future errors. •Patient empowerment and engagement in patient safety will lead to better outcomes and fewer errors. •Safety program development, implementation, and evaluation considerations include ⚬identifying needs and priorities at the organization, department, unit, team, and individual levels; ⚬determining how technology can support the program; ⚬integrating efforts with RM and infection prevention; ⚬monitoring and analyzing close calls, near-misses, and errors; ⚬supporting ethical practices in patient safety using fair and just culture principles; and •identifying strategies for adoption, spread, and evaluation of evidence-based safety interventions and innovations. Patient safety gets better through learning and doing using advanced technology, teamwork, and communication approaches that have been proven to mitigate errors, reduce harm and save lives. Healthcare quality professionals can lead and collaborate on these efforts. They possess the unique experience and expertise to advance safety practices in their organizations and the community-at-large. This can be accomplished by bringing knowledge, promising practices, improvement tools, and safety innovations to the healthcare setting. References 1.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

This section provides an overview of the historical development of performance and process improvement as well as the key principles and practices for performance improvement (PI) in healthcare quality and safety. The tenets of quality and safety must first be established through strategic planning to better align the activities with the organization’s mission, vision, values, goals, and objectives. Important to an organization’s success is the establishment of priorities for quality and PI activities, translating strategic goals into quality outcomes, and aligning organizational culture and structure to support quality. A formal quality and PI program with a defined scope and infrastructure is required to evaluate projects and performance toward desired goals. Fundamentals of a quality and PI program are described including tools and methods for use by healthcare quality professionals. An overview of teams and their roles and responsibilities is provided (e.g., team effectiveness, process champions, and process owners). Approaches to sharing successes and evaluating external award opportunities are also reviewed. Learning Objectives 1.Understand historical perspectives on healthcare quality and appreciate the contributions of the quality pioneers and visionaries. 2.Describe strategic planning and management considering current and evolving healthcare performance and process improvement approaches. p. 134 p. 135 3.Create a quality and PI plan that establishes priorities for quality, safety, and PI activities, develop action plans and projects, and provide training on performance and process improvement, program development, and evaluation. 4.Establish methods for evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines, critical pathways, and effective team building. 5.Identify opportunities for rewards, awards, and recognition for healthcare organizations and understand different ways to share organizational and personal successes (e.g., presentations, storyboards, and publications). The Evolution of Healthcare Quality There are individuals in the history of quality and PI who were influential in shaping current performance and process improvement approaches and techniques. Early pioneers viewed process as a sequence of activities and communications that fulfilled a service need for a client or customer and improving a process to yield quality outcomes.1 These early pioneers are briefly presented with their major contributions to the development of quality and performance management.

Quality Pioneers Walter Shewhart. In the 1920s, Walter Shewhart, a statistician at Bell Telephone Laboratories, developed the Shewhart Cycle, best known as plan–do–check–act (PDCA). This four-step process is designed to continuously improve quality (FIG. 3-1). The PDCA steps include the following: Plan. Question the capacity or capability of a process. Pose theories on how to improve the process and predict measurable outcomes. Do. Make changes on an experimental, pilot basis. Check. Measure outcomes compared to predicted outcomes. Act. Implement the changes on a broad scale.1 Figure 3-1 The traditional plan–do–check–act model. Later, Deming adapted the PDCA cycle as the plan–do–study–act (PDSA) cycle; therefore, it also is referred to as the Deming Cycle, or the Deming Wheel. Both PDCA and PDSA are used as improvement models. Shewhart is also credited with his work on statistical process control (SPC) charts. W. Edwards Deming. W. Edwards Deming is probably the most famous of the industrial quality gurus. A statistician with doctorates in mathematics and physics, he ultimately became the “philosopher of quality” and the learning organization. The story of post–World War II America’s rejection of Deming’s quality exhortations—and of his subsequent dealings with a receptive Japan—led to his being referred to as the “father of the third wave of the industrial revolution.”2(p2) In the 1950s, Deming visited the Western Electric Hawthorne Plant in Chicago while the Harvard University study regarding motivation of workers was in progress (hence the term “Hawthorne Effect” was coined from this work). Following this experience, he proposed replacing traditional management techniques with a statistically controlled management process to determine when—and when not—to intervene in a process. SPC techniques allow management to determine a range of random variation that always occurs in a process. SPC describes two types of causes of variation: common cause and special cause. Common-cause problems are rooted in basic processes and systems. Special-cause problems stem from isolated occurrences that are outside the system. SPC is discussed in Health Data Analytics and further explains how to understand control limits and define common- and special-cause variation.

Special-cause problems stem from isolated occurrences that are outside the system. SPC is discussed in Health Data Analytics and further explains how to understand control limits and define common- and special-cause variation. Deming said that 85% of the problems detected are process or system related, whereas 15% are traceable to individuals; this is known as the “85/15 p. 135 p. 136 theory.”3 Deming’s management philosophy is based on his 14 points for businesses that seek to be competitive: 1.Create a constancy of purpose toward quality improvement (QI). 2.Adopt a philosophy that expects good products and services. 3.Cease dependence on mass inspection, and build quality into the product or service. 4.Do not award business solely on price tag. 5.Improve constantly the system of production and service. 6.Institute on-the-job training. 7.Institute leadership with an arm to help people and machines do better jobs. 8.Drive out fear. 9.Break down barriers between departments. 10.Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets. 11.Eliminate number quotas and management by objective and substitute leadership. 12.Remove barriers to pride of workmanship. 13.Institute education and self-improvement. 14.Take action to accomplish the transformation.3,4 Joseph Juran. Juran’s background was in engineering and law. He followed Deming to Japan after World War II, emphasizing the key role of top organizational leadership and the importance “to lean on each other to help the other succeed.”5(p1) In Juran on Leadership for Quality,6 Juran states that quality is “product performance that results in customer satisfaction; freedom from product deficiencies which avoid customer dissatisfaction.”6(pp16,31) This concept is known as fitness for use and is explained in Juran’s Trilogy. Juran stated that the cost of quality accounting means there is a break-even point of less than 100%. Beyond a certain point, the cost of providing quality exceeds the value of the incremental improvement in quality. Juran’s Trilogy is analogous to certain familiar financial processes. Quality planning is equal to budgeting, quality control (sometimes called measurement) is comparable to cost control, and quality and PI relate to cost reduction and margin improvement.1 Philip H.

Crosby. In the 1970s and 1980s, Crosby developed an important concept known as the cost of [poor] quality. His work documented that high quality (what he terms “conformance to expectations”) is less costly than the waste and rework that characterizes poor-quality processes. Five stages of management maturity are identified by Crosby in his book, Quality Is Free.7 Crosby’s underlying philosophy is “Do it right the first time.” The stages are 1.uncertainty (when an organization is characterized by the statement, “We don’t know why we have quality problems”), 2.awakening, 3.enlightenment, 4.wisdom, and 5.certainty (reserved for organizations in which top management proclaims, “We know why we don’t have quality problems.” The mature company is equipped to initiate a QI program8). Crosby also identified 14 steps to improve quality and move a company toward “certainty,” including the following: Step 1. Management is committed to QI. Step 2. A QI team is formed to oversee actions. Step 3. Quality measurement is undertaken appropriate to the activities undergoing improvement. Step 4. Quality cost is evaluated, using estimates as necessary. Step 5. Quality awareness is promoted through various methods and supervisor involvement. Step 6. Corrective actions are generated in response to steps 3 and 4. Step 7. Zero-defects planning is tailored to the company and its products. Step 8. Supervisory training is undertaken at all management levels. Step 9. A zero-defects day is held to celebrate a new performance standard. Step 10. Goals are set for individuals and groups. Step 11. Error cause(s) is removed by management after notification. Step 12. Goals are met and recognized. Step 13. The quality council’s experiences, problems, and ideas are shared. Step 14. The process is repeated (the pursuit of quality is never-ending). Kaoru Ishikawa.

Figure 3-2 Quality movement timeline. p. 136 p. 137 The First Era: Nightingale, Codman, and the American College of Surgeons In 1863, Florence Nightingale noted that patients seemed to fare better in some London hospitals than in others. As a nurse, she was the first to call for systematic inquiry into the nature of care processes that could be related to outcome variability. Although there is little evidence that Nightingale’s quality vision came to fruition during her lifetime, Boston surgeon Ernest Codman’s early 20th-­century efforts had a more formal impact. Codman, who also observed variability in patient outcomes among several hospitals, called for a systematic evaluation process with a view toward improving care.10 Although his efforts met considerable resistance, Codman’s ideas were embodied in the founding of the American College of Surgeons in 1913. This body of work set about the task of establishing quality standards. In 1917, the College established a five-part “minimum standard,” and the Hospital Standardization Program was born.11 These were the early beginnings for hospital accreditation based on standards. The program was based on Codman’s end-result system of standardization in which hospitals would track every patient treated for long enough to determine if the treatment was effective. When treatment was found to be ineffective, the hospital would attempt to determine how such similar cases could be treated with success in the future. Codman is best known for his focus on outcomes. p. 137 p. 138 The Second Era: Donabedian and The Joint Commission’s Monitoring","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_6"}}],["214",{"pageContent":"hospital would attempt to determine how such similar cases could be treated with success in the future. Codman is best known for his focus on outcomes. p. 137 p. 138 The Second Era: Donabedian and The Joint Commission’s Monitoring and Evaluation Process Accreditation standards evolved slowly throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. At the academic level, the University of Michigan’s Dr. Avedis Donabedian examined existing research, formulating a theoretical framework for patient care evaluation.12 He is best recognized for his “structure, process, outcomes” model of quality evaluation (FIG. 3-3). Structure Process Outcomes Professionals Leadership Clinical Facilities Management Functional Technologies Interaction Experience Resources Diagnosis Engagement Organizations Therapy Figure 3-3 Donabedian’s framework. This model suggests the importance of relating healthcare structures (qualifications of practitioners and facilities and technology available to them) and processes (activities involved in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment) to outcomes (how patients fare because of their care). In the past, Joint Commission standards mainly reflected the structure and process elements of this model. Surveyors, who reviewed the structures and processes, assessed hospital plans and technology, qualifications of clinicians and administrators, and organizational structures against the annually updated requirements contained in the Comprehensive Accreditation Manual for Hospitals. Specialized standards for behavioral health and other services were also developed. Surveyors inferred process from documentation and discussion. They reviewed minutes and interviewed clinical and administrative leaders to ascertain whether designated individuals were following procedures and compliant with quality evaluation processes. As a matter of policy and practical considerations, accreditation standards did not address patient outcomes directly. First, there were problems with the way “quality” was measured. Second, no professional consensus existed on systematic measures of patient outcomes. Finally, uniform and comparable clinical databases were nonexistent. The problems of measuring and interpreting patient outcomes precluded their practical use in accreditation. Consequently, the accreditation process was necessarily built on an implicit assumption that if proper structures and processes were in place, good outcomes were likely to follow. As measurement systems matured, the evaluation of patient outcomes became a strong focus for accreditation processes as well as the organizational review of different aspects of care, treatment, and services.

The Third Era: Berwick, Batalden, and James “Discover” Deming, Juran, and “Japan, Inc.” The names of Drs. Donald Berwick, Paul Batalden, and Brent James are eminent in the field of healthcare quality and performance management. Like many of their colleagues, these physicians were dissatisfied with traditional healthcare quality assurance (QA) practices. These pioneering physicians, however, went beyond a mere critique of existing QA. Both Berwick and Batalden researched the industrial methods publicized by the Japanese experience. Arising from this research, Berwick’s article describing healthcare QA as based upon the “Theory of the Bad Apples” became a classic.13 Among his many contributions, Batalden translated Deming’s famous 14 points7 into a healthcare context.14 In 1987, these two physicians played key roles in linking with The Juran Institute and a variety of industrial quality consultants to create the National Demonstration Project on Quality Improvement in Health Care. This multiyear project and its original 21 forward-looking healthcare organizations conclusively demonstrated the applicability of PI processes to healthcare.15 James, of the Intermountain Health System, was also a pioneer in applying QI processes directly to patients and clinical outcomes. The success of James and his team measured not only improved results in a single hospital but also across the entire multihospital system.16,17 In 1991, Berwick established the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), a not-for-profit organization that began driving improvements in healthcare. It accomplished this by supporting national projects focused on the six aims—safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity.18 Collaboratives are one approach involving many organizations trying to affect the same issue and using rapid-cycle improvement efforts to implement change. A major benefit of this approach is that the collaborating organizations share their experiences and improvements spread quickly. Projects initiated include improvements in patient safety, chronic care, critical care, and end-of-life care. Berwick was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2010 and served for 18 months in President Obama’s administration. While in office, Berwick inculcated the “Triple Aim” into health policy: improving the patient care experience, improving population health, and reducing health costs.

Many healthcare organizations are taking the learnings from these leaders as well as newer methodologies and are advancing the science and experience of healthcare quality to serve as role models for others. For example, Virginia Mason led many lean initiatives by modeling the Toyota methods, and Catalysis (formerly ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value) is sharing its lean journey. The Fourth Era: Patient Is Front and Center of Quality and Safety with Growth of Advocacy, Engagement, and Activation Healthcare reform stresses an imperative to engage families in their own care. Enhancing patient-centered care that results in empowerment, engagement, and activation is everyone’s job. Patients and their families need to understand their role and responsibilities related to quality and safety. Patient-centered communication is shown to improve clinical outcomes and more patient-centric technology tools are available, which have been found to be most useful in managing chronic disease.20,21 Patient advocacy includes addressing the rights and responsibilities of patients and involving them in shared decision making, obtaining informed consent for treatment, and disclosing unanticipated outcomes. An advocate or ombudsman is often available to manage inquiries, requests, complaints, and grievances, with a process to document and track reported issues to resolution. An ethical framework is often applied with ethics consultation to respond to issues that may create conflict with the rights of the patient and the organization or others. A patient’s bill of rights was first adopted by the American Hospital Association (AHA) in 1973 and revised in 1992 (FIG. 3-4). More recently, the AHA published The Patient Care Partnership replacing the Rights with a plain-language brochure.22 The protection of the patient rights may include a variety of concerns, such as abuse, neglect, and exploitation; decision-making ability and use of surrogates or durable power of attorney; advance directives or living wills; and treatment without fear of retaliation.

Advocacy, engagement, and activation—all offer opportunities for improved healthcare quality and safety in the 21st century. See Patient Safety for more discussion of engagement and activation. Leadership and Performance Improvement The development of meaningful governance in quality and safety requires assessment of the governing body’s knowledge of PI. This is a key role of quality professionals responsible for organizing and coordinating quality management and PI activities for the organization and its medical staff. Healthcare quality professionals can promote the commitment to quality of the governing body and organizational leadership by providing useful information in a format easily understood by members who may lack familiarity with healthcare terminology and procedures.

Fundamental Principles of Leadership Leadership is the ability to influence an individual or group toward achievement of goals.27 Leadership and management are not identical. Leadership is determining the correct direction or path, whereas management is doing the correct things to stay on that path. Kotter28 notes that management is about coping with complexity through planning and budgeting; setting goals; organizing, staffing, and creating a structure to foster goal attainment; setting up mechanisms for monitoring; and controlling results. In contrast, leaders are responsible for coping with change by developing a vision for change and aligning the subsystems of the organization. Both strong leadership and management are necessary for high performance. Some people are great leaders but poor managers and vice versa; in some cases, a person may be successful in both roles. Leadership Framework There are many frameworks for leadership. As is true with the system framework, often it is less important to choose a framework than simply having one to guide behavior. Deming4 believed that managers were responsible for optimizing the system. Practices of exemplary leaders were explored by Kouzes and Posner,29 who identified five important general practices: inspire a shared vision, challenge the system, enable others to act, model the way, and encourage the heart. These principles are generic and therefore applicable to any type of organization. These five practices are one way of describing leadership. 1.Inspire a Shared Vision. For any change to be successful, leaders must provide a vision for quality and influence people to share that vision. This means getting people p. 140 p. 141 to accept and believe in the core values underlying PI by developing a strong culture. 2.Challenge the System. Challenging the system means acting as a change agent for that vision. It also means recognizing good ideas and demonstrating a willingness to stretch and grow to improve the quality of care. This, too, involves adoption of core values as a learning organization. 3.Enable Others to Act. The third leadership practice is enabling others to act by sharing decision-making and power. Along with sharing power, enabling involves having an appropriate structural design and resources to support quality and safety initiatives. 4.Model the Way. Much behavior is learned through role modeling. Effective leaders must model desired behaviors as actions speak louder than words. 5.Encourage the Heart. The last practice is critical.

Change is difficult, even if it is done for the right reasons. Encouraging the heart means recognizing contributions employees make and celebrating the core values and victories. The most important point of any reward system is to reward the desired behaviors. Leaders use these five practices to keep subsystems aligned. However, leaders must first engage people to support a common vision of quality. One way this occurs is through a strong supportive culture of quality and safety. See Organizational Leadership for more information on leadership and culture, and their impact on performance and process improvement. The Governing Body The organization’s governing body or board of directors bears ultimate responsibility for setting policy, financial and strategic direction, and the quality of care and service provided by all its practitioners. Together with the organization’s management and medical staff leaders, the governing body sets priorities for QI activities. The AHA outlined Principles of Accountability for Hospitals and Healthcare Organizations, with specific directives for governing board and leadership.30 These government and leadership directives are described in TABLE 3-1. A new document was published in 2015 with a joint American Hospital Association/American Medical Association (AHA/AMA) statement in Integrated Leadership for Hospitals and Health Systems: Principles for Success,31 which addresses integrated leadership and includes six principles: Table 3-1 American Hospital Association’s (AHA) Principles of Accountability for Hospitals and Healthcare Organizations: Governance/Leadership Mission and Vision. The organization’s governing body and leadership should articulate clearly defined mission and vision statements. With these statements as a foundation, the organization’s leadership should develop an action plan with specific goals, time frames for accomplishment, and linked measures of performance for a regular assessment of achievement, with oversight by the governing body. As part of this development process, the organization’s governing body and leadership should seek input from relevant stakeholders concerning their needs and interests relative to the organization. The plan and the results should be widely communicated to all individuals who are employed by or affiliated with the organization. Executive Management Oversight. The organization’s governing body is responsible for the oversight of the organization’s leadership performance and should periodically evaluate that performance relative to the organization’s achievement of its stated strategic goals.

Quality Oversight. The organization’s governing body and leadership, in conjunction with the clinical staff, are responsible for developing and implementing, in a comprehensive manner, systems and procedures for safeguarding and enhancing the quality of patient care and services. The governing body and leadership, in conjunction with the clinical staff, are also responsible for actively monitoring and immediately acting upon, where appropriate, the results derived from those systems and procedures such that patient and staff safety is ensured or improvements in patient care occur. Financial Stability. The organization’s governing body is responsible for ensuring the financial well-being of the organization and, in conjunction with the organization’s leadership, for overseeing the appropriate and most optimal allocation of financial and physical resources for the improvement of patient care. The organization’s mission and duty to improve patient care and community health must not be obstructed by (and must take precedence over) the financial interests of individuals or groups employed by or affiliated with the organization.

Organizational Strategy and Performance Management The following discussion on performance management centers on the organizational level in the context of meeting the organization’s strategic goals and objectives. Performance management is defined as “a forward-looking process used to set goals and regularly check progress toward achieving those goals. In practice, an organization sets goals, looks at the actual data for its performance measures, and acts on results to improve the performance toward its goals.”32(p1) The goal of a performance management system is to make certain that the vision of the organization is being met by defining and measuring outcomes reflected in that vision. Although there are a variety of quality and PI programs, including the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program and the European Foundation for Quality Management, many government agencies and Fortune 1000 companies use the balanced scorecard (BSC) as an approach to performance management. BSCs are completely compatible with other quality performance programs but go beyond such programs by embedding quality and PI in the strategic framework of the organization.33 The BSC was developed by Norton and Kaplan in the early 1990s. The basic idea is that performance measures provide a comprehensive view of organizational performance and not be overly dependent on a few choice indicators. Unlike other performance models, the BSC helps organizations better link long-term strategy with short-term activities.34 The BSC approach views the organization from four different perspectives or categories: financial (“How do we look to providers of financial resources?”), customer (“How do our customers see us?”), internal business processes (“At what must we excel?”), and learning and growth (“Can we continue to improve and create value for customers?”). Answers to these questions influence the nature of the strategic goals and objectives that are set and, ultimately, what performance measures are used.

Answers to these questions influence the nature of the strategic goals and objectives that are set and, ultimately, what performance measures are used. The critical aspect of performance indicators is that they must reflect the organization’s strategic goals and objectives. There are likely to be several strategic objectives corresponding to each of the four perspectives. Each of these objectives has at least one measure with vetted measurement properties (e.g., reliability, validity, qualitative data, quantitative data) and can be collected through a variety of means (e.g., surveys, focus groups, patient chart reviews). Health Resources & Services Administration suggests that development and use of different types of measures (i.e., structure, process, outcomes) in each of the categories is an important “balanced” approach.32 The foundation for an organization’s strategic success begins with its people, who must be willing to learn and grow. To meet the changing needs of customers, they must, for example, learn new technology and acquire new skills to take on new responsibilities. The strategic goal “Develop a state-of-the-art program for breast cancer detection and treatment” could consider measures such as •structure: quantity of imaging equipment; •process: number of patients diagnosed with imaging technology; and •outcome: higher percentage of early diagnoses, due to use of imaging technology. It is necessary to monitor and improve key processes so that employees can convert learning and growth into products and services or quality outcomes. “Be recognized as one of the top healthcare providers in the community” could be another strategic goal. Measures might include •structure: resources available for care delivery (e.g., nurse–patient ratio); •process: care (how patients are diagnosed and treated); and •outcomes: results of care (e.g., satisfaction, length and quality of life, turnover rates). Just as different organizational levels and units develop goals and objectives based on corporate strategy, different levels and units also can use the BSC or similar dashboard approach. The use of a scorecard or dashboard to reflect an organization’s key strategic goals or priorities or “pillars” is still in active use but terms often morph over time. A review of these concepts can be noted by reviewing Baldrige healthcare recipients in which results are focused on patient safety and quality as key perspectives, not just the traditional BSC perspectives. p. 142 p. 143 Note: for the same strategic goal (e.g., be recognized as one of the top healthcare providers in the community) there","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_16"}}],["224",{"pageContent":"on patient safety and quality as key perspectives, not just the traditional BSC perspectives. p. 142 p. 143 Note: for the same strategic goal (e.g., be recognized as one of the top healthcare providers in the community) there are several measures of performance across different perspectives. Structure for Performance and Process Improvement Every organization should have an organization-wide plan for PI. The plan defines examples of key activities or core processes and quality control methods for each service. There are numerous federal, state, and local-level regulations and accreditation standards that govern quality monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. This is especially true for diagnostic services such as pathology and laboratory services, radiology, nuclear medicine, and pharmacy. Content experts in these services lead the identification of regulations or other requirements and the specific quality control processes and measures that must be maintained. The requirements may include provisions for employee exposure monitoring, including issuance of individual radiology badges or devices. Quality and performance management personnel are often involved in the direct monitoring within services or the aggregation of data or reports from different services in the organization. The unit or service level is considered a microsystem, and it is at this level that change happens and improvements generally occur. The service-level plan includes •identifying populations served; •describing services provided; •PI priorities at the service level, aligned with the organization’s goals and strategic plan; •identifying any requirements related to PI, quality control, and quality monitoring (e.g., accreditation standards, regulations, device monitoring, quality control); •selecting valid and reliable metrics for the service; •developing a monitoring plan (e.g., sample, frequency, reporting); •developing a plan for evaluating performance; and •identifying methods for improving the performance. A standard format can make the development of plans or quality monitoring across multiple services and sites more efficient and effective for tracking, trending, and reporting. The service-level plan should support the organization-wide plan which identifies the framework for all services, organization-level priorities and goals, resources, and metrics. Discussion of the different aspects to consider in the planning process for PI follows. Setting Priorities The road to quality healthcare begins with strategic planning to guide the organization in focusing on the most important aspects or priorities. Priorities for performance and process improvement activities are based on several standard approaches. The first approach is that the priorities are aligned with the organization’s strategic direction to maximize resources for improvement, and the second is a criteria-based approach considering risk, volume, problem","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_17"}}],["225",{"pageContent":"Priorities for performance and process improvement activities are based on several standard approaches. The first approach is that the priorities are aligned with the organization’s strategic direction to maximize resources for improvement, and the second is a criteria-based approach considering risk, volume, problem proneness, patient safety, cost, customer satisfaction, and other criteria established specifically by the organization. The pillars identified by Studer are also often used as the categories of improvement priorities: Quality, People, Finance, Service, Growth and Community.35 In some organizations, safety has recently been added to the pillars of excellence model. A framework for leadership of improvement is the first step in turning the strategic plan into an operational plan for improvement. In this framework, leaders apply the mission, vision, values, and strategic plan to set direction. This framework is built on a foundational leadership team to support improvement capability. The three components of will to prepare for change, ideas to generate new ways of performing, and execution of change contribute to a leadership system for improvement. Models depicting the framework and how the framework operates in an integrated system are shown in FIGURES 3-5 and 3-6. Figure 3-5 Framework for leading improvement.

In addition, healthcare quality professionals and their teams use the described criteria to prioritize performance and process improvement activities based on the quantitative and qualitative data available to them. By using past performance, aligned with the criteria and strategic initiatives, the team can determine the priorities for action. A plan is often written by healthcare quality professionals and approved by the clinical leaders to ensure success of the activities, especially in allocating adequate resources for the effort. p. 143 p. 144 The initiatives having the most opportunity for improvement are often tackled first. Usually, the initiatives selected focus on core clinical processes, high-risk processes, high-risk patients and populations, high-risk medications, or high-risk actions or interventions. The level of risk is based on the potential consequences of injury or harm to patients. In an acute care hospital setting, a high-risk process might be blood transfusions, while in long-term care it might be fall prevention, and within an office practice, it might be ensuring timely immunizations. Healthcare quality professionals need to identify those processes for specific settings. Another aspect in assessing level of risk is the frequency with which the process or procedure is performed. For example, responding to a case of sepsis or malignant hyperthermia would be considered high risk for the patient, and if the staff does not manage this scenario often, they may not respond as a highly effective team. Therefore, it may be a priority to perform drills to ensure that staff is competent. Managing p. 144 p. 145 high-risk patients and processes significantly affect morbidity and mortality.

Key steps to implementing PI activities to ensure success of the PI priorities follow: 1.Ensure leadership support and commitment for the PI initiative. 2.Assess priority and feasibility of initiative based on risk, resources, leadership support, and organizational strategies. 3.Identify the aim of the initiative and include the topic, process, or problem to be improved (provide a good rationale). 4.Convene an interdisciplinary team of content and process experts with all key disciplines as participants (involve all the right stakeholders with a champion for change). 5.Use tools and techniques to analyze processes, best practices, research, and consensus-based evidence for the desired change. 6.Develop the change to be implemented and add timelines and accountability for the project. 7.Identify the measures to demonstrate that the change resulted in improvement; set performance goals. 8.Educate staff on the desired change. 9.Implement and test the change via the redesigned processes. 10.Collect, analyze, and evaluate data on the redesigned process. 11.Make additional changes based on findings and disseminate to all areas. 12.Report and display results to reward staff for improvements. 13.Continue to monitor performance to ensure that the change is sustained. 14.Compare performance internally and externally. 15.Celebrate successes internally and externally.37,38 p. 145 p. 146 When choosing between improvement activities, use a prioritization matrix (FIG. 3-8) to assist in evaluating the items against specific criteria.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_20"}}],["228",{"pageContent":"15.Celebrate successes internally and externally.37,38 p. 145 p. 146 When choosing between improvement activities, use a prioritization matrix (FIG. 3-8) to assist in evaluating the items against specific criteria.

Planning and Evaluation of Improvement Projects and Activities Healthcare quality professionals often guide the planning and evaluation for projects and activities. The first step is to understand data and tools to construct an overall plan and specifically the data collection plan. This includes the following steps: 1.Determine who, what, when, where, how, and why. 2.Structure the design. 3.Choose and develop a sampling method. 4.Determine learning needs and conduct training. p. 146 p. 147 5.Delegate responsibilities. 6.Facilitate coordination. 7.Forecast budget. 8.Conduct pilots or tests of change. A clear understanding of data and tools to assist in problem identification and solutions is needed to facilitate planning and evaluating improvement projects. An overview of data and data management is provided with some of the more common tools used in these processes later in this section. Evaluation and Selection of EBP Guidelines Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the “conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”40(p71) Because multiple disciplines are involved in healthcare delivery, however, the term evidence-based practice (EBP) is more appropriate than EBM from a healthcare quality perspective. Clinicians not only base their care on the experimental evidence but also consider experiential evidence, physiologic principles, patient and professional values, and system features in their decision making.41 This allows individualized application and dissemination of aggregate research evidence.41,42 EBP promotes patient safety through the provision of effective and efficient healthcare, resulting in less variation in care and fewer unnecessary or nontherapeutic interventions.43 EBP and outcomes measurement are iterative; one facilitates the other.44 EBP complements the principles of continuous quality improvement (CQI).

Outcome evaluation at the individual and aggregate level is an essential step in evaluating the impact of EBP. p. 147 p. 148 Evidence-based quality management is based on two types of research: clinical research and health services research. Clinical research evaluates the impact of interventions on patient outcomes. Outcome measures may include clinical outcomes, functional outcomes, and patient satisfaction. This type of research assists healthcare quality professionals in determining clinical evidence-based best practices. Health services research evaluates the health system at the micro and macro levels. Results from this type of research guide healthcare quality professionals in improving work processes and systems of care. To facilitate research-based practice—that is, to promote research use—healthcare quality professionals must collaborate with organizational leaders to promote a culture of excellence. Healthcare providers must be motivated to provide the best possible care and to use the best system processes based on the evidence in the research literature or on data obtained in their own organizations; they must want to strive for excellence. A key strategy is to keep all discussions based on improving the patient’s experience and outcomes and keep personality conflicts out of the conversation, based on previously established ground rules. Research use is a key aspect of the CQI process and critical to obtaining healthcare quality as defined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The rating of evidence for EBP is often based on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) levels of evidence and grading system. The USPSTF, created in 1984, is a group of independent experts in prevention and EBM that makes evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services. Evidence for practice can be classified by certain levels or strength of the evidence. The USPSTF also defined levels of certainty about net benefit (see TABLE 3-2). The USPSTF levels of evidence are often used to rate the evidence so that practitioners can make wise decisions about care and treatment options with some degree of certainty about outcomes. Strong evidence is transformed into practice and then measured in standardized formats. For example, there is strong evidence that timely administration of aspirin in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) decreases mortality. This practice was implemented widely, as in the Joint Commission Core Measure for AMI. As organizations achieved sustained performance, this measure was dropped.

This practice was implemented widely, as in the Joint Commission Core Measure for AMI. As organizations achieved sustained performance, this measure was dropped. Over time as evidence is strengthened, measures will continue to evolve and organizations such as the Joint Commission and CMS and p. 148 p. 149 others will modify requirements. The newest transition is to an electronic capture and submission of measures known as electronic Clinical Quality Measures. Organizations make practices operational by using clinical pathways, standard order sets, plans of care, and ongoing measurement processes. Table 3-2 Levels of Certainty about Net Benefit Level of Certainty Description High The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. Moderate The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by factors such as: •the number, size, or quality of individual studies, •inconsistency of findings across individual studies, •limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice, and •lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: •the limited number or size of studies, •important flaws in study design or methods, •inconsistency of findings across individual studies, •gaps in the chain of evidence, •findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice, and •lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. Note: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.From U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Clinical Guidelines and Pathways Clinical guidelines are consensus statements developed to assist in clinical management decisions, and clinical pathways are tools to manage quality outcomes and cost of care based on clinical guidelines and current evidence. Clinical pathways are document-based tools that provide a link between the best available evidence and clinical practice. Clinical pathways, also known as care pathways, critical pathways, integrated care pathways, or care maps, are one tool used to manage the quality in healthcare concerning the standardization of care processes. A variety of terms are used for this tool. For simplicity, the term clinical pathway is used here. Clinical pathways support EBP and clinical guidelines in a time-oriented plan. The use of pathways or guidelines reduces variation of clinical practice to optimize patient outcomes. The concept was introduced in 1985 by Zander and Bower at the New England Medical Center in Boston. They were early nursing pioneers in applying process management thinking and techniques to improve patient care.45 Clinical pathways operationalize evidence into daily practice for patient care. They are intended to create an integrated comprehensive approach or plan to the patient’s care rather than individual professions functioning independently. Interdisciplinary communication, collaboration, and teamwork are enhanced by working from one pathway, and continuity and care coordination are achieved for the patient. The pathway shapes expectations or outcomes of care as the patient progresses, based on what is the best practice for most patients most of the time. The pathway is written in a manner to ensure that actions or interventions are completed at designated points with the expected outcome. They are designed to support clinical management, clinical and nonclinical resource management, audit management, and p. 149 p. 150 financial management. Often, the improved clinical outcomes are intended to support cost-effective use of resources such as length of stay, diagnostic tests, and pharmaceutical management. Because there are differences in the responses for the same condition or treatment, individual variances must be captured, documented, and addressed.

Because there are differences in the responses for the same condition or treatment, individual variances must be captured, documented, and addressed. This continuous monitoring and data evaluation component is essential to pathway improvement through continual revision of pathways. It is expected that over time variation decreases through standardization, costs decrease, and the value of care improves. Although standardization is important to the pathways, they are not intended to be overly prescriptive and still allow personalized care. However, one critique of pathways is that not all variation in patient care is negative, and standardized care or “cookbook medicine” would be a detriment to patient care and clinician autonomy. Individual patient factors may contribute to variation that cannot be controlled by the system. Pathways tend to address processes in the ideal or uncomplicated patient and may not address problems in most patients. It is important to identify which patients are appropriate for the pathway. In general, pathways are more applicable to patients with uncomplicated illnesses undergoing procedures or surgery. Complex cases with multiple co-morbidities may be more difficult to fit into a standard pathway. The standardized approach is designed to empower patients such that each patient knows the plan and his or her expected outcome at each phase of recovery (e.g., on postoperative day 2, the hip replacement patient is expected to ambulate a defined number of steps or feet and void without a urinary catheter). Standardization also helps reduce clinical risk by ensuring that for specific conditions there are no lapses in care to be provided, and if outcomes are not met there is an immediate assessment of the reason. When differences or unwanted variances do occur, they are noted and accommodations made in the plan of care to ensure safety and effectiveness. Some common areas addressed by clinical pathways include orthopedic surgery such as hips, knees, and shoulders. Surgical care is more conducive to clinical pathways than medical conditions, where more differences in the patient’s condition are more likely to occur. Clinical pathways facilitate the development of standardized physician order sets, interventions for the patient, and documentation of the patient’s condition, and they are often used in the following situations: •prevalent pathology in the care setting (e.g., pain); •pathology with a significant risk for patients (e.g., venous thromboembolism), high cost for the hospital (e.g., total hip joint replacement), or well-defined permitting homogeneous care (e.g., laminectomy, transurethral","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_28"}}],["236",{"pageContent":"ology with a significant risk for patients (e.g., venous thromboembolism), high cost for the hospital (e.g., total hip joint replacement), or well-defined permitting homogeneous care (e.g., laminectomy, transurethral prostate resection); •predictable clinical course (e.g., total knee or hip replacement); •possibility of obtaining professional agreement (e.g., coronary angioplasty); •existence of recommendations of good practices or expert opinion (e.g., diabetes); •multidisciplinary implementation (e.g., joint replacement); and •relatively mature guidelines (e.g., stroke).46 Although based on current evidence or clinical guidelines, the clinical pathway details the process of care for the specific condition and, in noting any variances, highlights inefficiencies. Twenty-seven studies involving 11,398 participants were included in a meta-analysis of clinical pathway effectiveness.47 Twenty studies compared stand-alone clinical pathways to usual care. These studies indicated a reduction in inhospital complications and improved documentation. There was no evidence of differences in readmission to hospital or inhospital mortality. Length of stay was the most commonly employed outcome measure with most studies reporting significant reductions. A decrease in hospital costs or charges was also observed. Seven studies compared clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. No evidence of differences was found between intervention and control groups. There are both strengths and limitations of the pathway process that an organization must consider in its development and use of the tool. The development of a clinical pathway includes the following steps: 1.Select the topic. The topic concentrates on high-volume, high-cost diagnoses and procedures; higher mortality; longer length of stay; or greater number of outcome variations. Surgical procedures are more suitable for pathways because of the predictable course of events that occur during the hospitalization. 2.Select a multidisciplinary team, including representatives from all groups that would be affected by the pathway. Without physician support of the pathway, it is unlikely to be successful and achieve any of the stated goals. 3.Evaluate and map the current process of care for the condition or procedure to identify current variation and create an idealized process. 4.Evaluate the current evidence in the literature. In the absence of best practices, comparison with other organizations, or benchmarking, is the best method to use. 5.Determine the clinical pathway form.

It is critical to define roles within the pathway for it to be successful. 7.Document and analyze variances that do not meet the expectation of the pathway. Identification of factors that p. 150 p. 151 contribute to variance and interventions to improve those factors are the key features of process improvement. Often, a case manager or other utilization management staff member collects data on use of the pathway and variances. These data must then be analyzed and processes improved to achieve cost savings, quality and safety. A clinical practice guideline (CPG) is defined in a very structured manner by the Institute of Medicine as a “statement that includes recommendations that intend to optimize patient care. They are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options.”48(pp25–26) A medical guideline (also called a clinical guideline, clinical protocol, or CPG) is a document with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment in specific areas of healthcare. Following a guideline is never mandatory. The National Guideline Clearinghouse™ (NGC) is a publicly available database of evidence-based CPGs and related documents.49 It provides Internet users with free online access to guidelines. The NGC is updated weekly as evidence is acknowledged and subject matter experts review guidelines for practice. The key components of the NGC include •structured, standardized abstracts (summaries) about each guideline and its development; •a utility for comparing attributes of two or more guidelines in a side-by-side comparison; •syntheses of guidelines covering similar topics, highlighting areas of similarity and difference; •links to full-text guidelines, where available, and/or ordering information for print copies; and •annotated bibliographies on guideline development methodology, structure, implementation, and evaluation. Guidelines are organized by clinical specialty areas such as Cardiology, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Geriatrics, Infectious Diseases, Pediatrics, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Psychiatry.

Users of the CPG can check the site periodically as evidence is updated to ensure practice is following the most current evidence. Another tool to apply evidence into practice to improve healthcare quality is the concept of “bundles.”50 The IHI developed the concept of the bundle in 2001, and it is now commonly used for selected conditions. The original initiative was a joint development of the IHI and the Voluntary Hospitals of America (VHA), focused on improving critical care and increasing reliability of processes and thereby improve outcomes. (*Note that in 2015 the VHA and University HealthSystem Consortium merged as Vizient, Inc.). A bundle is defined as “a small set of evidence-based interventions for a defined patient segment/population and care setting that, when implemented together, result in significantly better outcomes than when implemented individually.”50(pp1–2) There are guidelines to the bundle design that include the following: •The bundle has three to five interventions (elements), with strong clinician agreement. •Each bundle element is relatively independent. •The bundle is used with a defined patient population in one location. •The multidisciplinary care team develops the bundle. •Bundle elements are descriptive rather than prescriptive, which allows for local customization and use of clinical judgment.50(p5) The first two bundles included ventilator-associated events and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). Through ongoing testing and application of the bundles in clinical practice, modifications were made to the original elements and new bundles developed such as the sepsis bundle and perinatal care bundle. “The use of bundles of care interventions as an approach to improving the reliability of care received by patients and preventing certain serious clinical outcomes has been demonstrated successfully for nearly 10 years, with a growing body of published results.”50(pp2–5) When assessing processes of bundle use and outcomes, an “all or none” measurement is used to ensure reliability in providing care that offers the best evidence to prevent adverse events and improve outcomes.

Often healthcare quality professionals are directly involved in data collection or reporting of bundle compliance as well as the outcomes of care such as ventilator-associated events or CLABSI—key measures of harm to patients. Performance and Process Improvement Approaches Definitions and requirements for quality and PI in healthcare evolved over the past decades. In the early 1950s, quality care reviews were conducted exclusively by individual physicians using an unstructured and subjective process that relied on the practitioner’s knowledge and experiences. Between 1950 and 1960, the responsibility for quality of care expanded beyond the physician to include both the hospital and the board of directors. Two significant legal decisions marked this transition period: •Bing v. Thunig (1957). In this case, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the doctrine of charitable immunity no longer applied to hospitals; hospitals are liable for patient injuries sustained through negligence of employees. p. 151 p. 152 •Darling v. Charleston Community Memorial Hospital (1965). In this important corporate negligence case, the court ruled that the hospital had a legal responsibility to protect a patient from harm by others by overseeing the quality of patient care. These cases shifted the thinking about accountability for safety and quality of care delivered by hospitals and set into motion the beginning of quality reviews. This progressed over time into current PI models. There are a variety of PI models and they each have value and usefulness depending on the type of problem, scope, and solution needed. The process for determining which PI model or models to use in an organization requires an analysis of the organization and its track record of success with current and previous models. How will the model be communicated across the organization? Are all staff members expected to know how to use it? Which model or models are a good fit with the culture and the current strategies that are working? Healthcare quality professionals may be asked to provide a review and analysis of the PI methodology currently in use and compare it with alternative options. As more sophisticated tools and methods become available, the quality professionals must keep pace and serves an important role in the final selection(s) of what tools to use in which situations—the best tool for the right situation at the right time.

Retrospective Audits A shift from physician review to medical audits occurred in 1955. Medical audits included a systematic procedure using objective, valid criteria with an orientation on outcomes. In 1966, there was a major change whereby the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (as it was called then; now The Joint Commission or TJC) focused on optimal, not minimal, standards of care. In 1975, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH) published the quality of professional services standards, requiring hospitals to demonstrate optimal care using valid and reliable measures. Although optimal was never defined, this new focus led to one-time audits of care, known as performance evaluation programs audits. While audits have historical roots, they are still a method often used depending on the type of information to be validated. Quality Assurance Audits soon led to a preoccupation with meeting audit number requirements. Thus, in 1980 the JCAH, now known as TJC, developed the first QA standards requiring a problem-focused approach to measuring quality. This approach required organizations to identify and monitor problem areas. The combined strengths of criteria-based audits and the epidemiologic approach used in infection control in the 1980s resulted in a new focus on systematic monitoring and evaluation in 1985. From this, a 10-step process for quality and PI evolved in 1986 requiring organizations to evaluate important aspects of care and then use the results to identify opportunities for improvement. Reengineering and System Redesign In the 1990s, reengineering was one of the major initiatives in hospitals. Most of these efforts were focused on workforce redesign. There was typically a focus on restructuring or redesigning systems and departments into more efficient processes. For example, hospitals experimented with creating new positions that combined work from several different areas. A focus on cross-functional capabilities led to the dissolution of departmental silos. A “patient service associate” or “technical associate” would deliver meals, clean patient rooms, stock supplies, and provide patient transportation. Many hospitals thought that reengineering would increase profit margins and create financial stability. The problem was that reengineering often became associated with mergers, acquisitions, downsizing, and layoffs. When this happened, employee morale declined and productivity suffered. Because of these negative connotations, reengineering fell out of vogue and was replaced by other improvement models and initiatives.

When this happened, employee morale declined and productivity suffered. Because of these negative connotations, reengineering fell out of vogue and was replaced by other improvement models and initiatives. The newer approach is to consider adopting the Lean Enterprise method to increase financial stability by eliminating waste. The key components and tools of a Lean Enterprise include identifying value (value stream mapping and voice of customer), eliminating waste, establishing flow, enabling pull (instead of push) systems, and pursuing perfection. The Six Sigma method includes a five-step process: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC). See TABLE 3-4 for the process and key questions for the healthcare quality professional to consider during each step in the DMAIC process. Lean Enterprise and Six Sigma are often complementary tools. Lean Enterprise focuses on dramatically improving flow in the value stream and eliminating waste to improve efficiency and speed. Six Sigma methodology focuses on eliminating defects and reducing variation in processes to improve effectiveness.

Control Plan Control Charts Dashboard Standard Operating Procedures and Policy Revision Checklist/Audits The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established the national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC) under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS).

Fundamental to the collaborative approach is the acceptance of a model and the establishment of an infrastructure through which collaborating organizations can identify and prioritize aims for improvement and gain access to methods, tools, and materials to conduct sophisticated, evidence-based activities that they could not successfully conduct on their own. The key elements of success are enlisting a broad range of partners, using EBP to improve quality of care, and developing toolkits that contain essential information and resources to manage change. At the core of the collaborative approach is the PDCA cycle that builds on incremental improvements. The real benefits to organizations that participate in the Breakthrough Series are that they can learn from other organizations’ successes and failures. Another key principle in the IHI approach is the concept of spread. IHI proposed that successful small-scale improvement efforts initially affect an individual organization and spread later to the industry (i.e., other hospitals) and eventually to the entire national healthcare system. The spread is fostered through learning sessions in which organizations share their experiences. The IHI approach also can be adapted to a single organization (the work begins in a few units or teams and then is spread to other units and, eventually, to the entire organization). See FIGURE 3-11, which illustrates how the multiple improvement cycles in a collaborative occur.52 Participation in a collaborative is one approach that organizations may choose for improvement in a specific area. The IHI is one organization that offers national 10 to 12 month collaboratives such as Reducing Falls and Falls with Injuries; Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB); Health Disparities; Primary Care Teams to Meet Patients’ Medical and Behavioral Needs; Perinatal Improvement in Community; IHI Triple Aim Improvement Community; and Improving Outcomes for High-Risk and Critically Ill Patients.

Six Sigma Six Sigma is a business management strategy, originally developed by Motorola. This rigorous methodology, used in many different industry sectors, uses data and statistical analyses to measure and improve performance through the reduction of variation. Quality is improved by eliminating errors in production and service-related processes. Six Sigma is based on the concept of the normal distribution or curve and the belief that there is a point, six standard deviations from the mean, where there should be almost zero defects. Therefore, error rates do not exceed 3.4 defects per million opportunities. Six Sigma can be characterized as obtaining the right measures (or metrics) of quality, using rigorous statistical methods, and possessing a customer-focused and data-driven philosophy. In 1998, Chassin concluded “We can learn a good deal from industries that are working toward the Six Sigma goal. Let’s try it in healthcare and see how close we can get.”53(p587) Over the past several years, this approach took hold in many hospitals and health systems. With cost, quality, and regulatory pressures continuing to increase within the healthcare industry, Six Sigma gained more attention from hospitals and health systems seeking a better approach to achieving p. 154 p. 155 long-term results. This approach to improving quality can be used to address many of the challenges facing healthcare, including resource utilization, patient safety, appropriate use of technology, and increasing market share. Six Sigma efforts typically include a methodology that addresses variation and goes by the acronym “DMAIC” (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control). A Six Sigma project can address process redesign, a problem that needs to be solved, a change that needs to be instituted, or a process that needs to be monitored. Six Sigma projects are managed by Black Belts, who oversee the project. Black Belts are members of the organization who are extensively trained in Six Sigma methods.

Yellow and Green Belts are organization frontline members who are knowledgeable about Six Sigma methods but who received less training than Black Belts. For major projects an organization also assigns a senior manager or executive to act as a sponsor. Six Sigma shows success in reducing emergency room wait times, lost charges for billing in financial services, delinquent medical records, diagnostic result turnaround times, account receivable days, patients’ length of stay, and medication errors.54 Lean Enterprise The Japanese automotive industry initiated the concept of lean manufacturing, whereby great importance is given to reducing waste and focusing on those activities that add value for the customer. Interest in applying similar principles in service industry environments, including healthcare, is continuing to grow. Lean enterprise includes five basic principles: 1.Specify value from the end customer’s perspective. 2.Identify all steps in the value stream for each service, eliminating the non-value-added steps. 3.Make the value-adding steps flow without interruption to the customer. 4.Implement a pull system based on customer demand. 5.As value is specified, value streams are identified, non-value-added steps are removed, and flow and pull are introduced, go back to the first step and continue until a state of perfection is received.55 A key focus in a lean enterprise is to eliminate waste in eight key areas: defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra processing.56 An explanation of wastes found in healthcare (with examples in each category and the common strategy to address the waste) is given in TABLE 3-5. One of the major distinctions of the lean p. 155 p. 156 approach versus traditional QI is its emphasis on investigating new ways of getting things done and making the changes in a short period. The basic idea is to identify new procedures that are designed to be more effective than existing systems, ultimately resulting in eliminating waste. QI has typically used the incremental change model, but lean enterprise is more concerned with speed and total redesign. A key element of success is the commitment and involvement of frontline workers and staff in the change process. The typical project includes cross-functional teams with training in lean principles and tools.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_38"}}],["246",{"pageContent":"change model, but lean enterprise is more concerned with speed and total redesign.

The newer approach is a combination of both Lean and Six Sigma as there is value in reducing waste, speeding up the process, and reducing variation. Naik et al.57 applied lean principles to their emergency department, which improved overall length of stay, time of arrival to triage completion, time of arrival to being seen by a provider, and increased provider productivity. Significant improvements in workflow were realized. Of note, the Lean philosophy encompasses the concept of True North. “True North” is a key concept in Lean process improvement that emerged from Toyota and connotes the compass needle for Lean transformation. True North works like a compass, providing a guide to take an organization from the current condition to where they want to be. It might be viewed as a purpose of the organization, and the foundation of a strategic plan. Later other approaches are explained that determine the organization’s direction and important metrics, pillars, dashboard metrics, or key success factors. The use of Lean and Six Sigma constitute what The Joint Commission refer to as robust process improvement which supports organizations to be highly reliable.58 Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Performance monitoring is an important component of a quality, safety, and performance management program.

Areas for monitoring and evaluation are identified in accreditation standards, local, state and federal regulatory requirements, and organizational demands. Generally, these areas are high risk or problem prone. When quality or safety issues are identified, they may be subject to review or audit. General criteria to be considered for a review or audit include the following: •Was the intervention used? •Was it performed properly using specific criteria? •Was it performed safely? •Was there any adverse effect or outcome to the patient? •Was staff competent to perform the intervention? •Was it effective (this may include cost effectiveness)? •Was there a better alternative to the intervention? Areas most commonly monitored are presented and the general criteria are applied to demonstrate specific monitoring and evaluation processes. Examples are provided that may be applied in a variety of settings but may not apply to all settings based on populations served and the specific services and functions within a setting. Healthcare quality professionals work in a variety of settings and will need to determine the key functions within the setting and apply the concepts of prioritization, EBP for the setting/population, and applicable performance monitoring tools. Not every setting and every type of monitoring process can be discussed in detail. As healthcare quality professionals determine how to apply monitoring resources, they should understand their setting. For example, the hospital setting provides care for the highest risk and most acute patients with the most intense and costly resources (e.g., severity of illness and intensity of services). Depending on the size and complexity of the services offered, this may range from acute trauma, cardiothoracic and neurosurgical care to basic surgery in a rural setting, and initiatives may focus on TCAB, bundles for preventing infections, and core measures. This setting is the costliest, but is episodic and not the primary site for most healthcare. Long-term care services may include short-term rehabilitation, long-term care, and dementia or memory care. While this setting can be costly long term, it serves a specific population. The clinical office is the primary locus of care for most persons. The physician office practice for primary care focuses on preventive measures such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), which is aimed at better health and wellness.

See Health Data Analytics for further discussion. Medication Use Safe medication practices, including medication use evaluation, pharmacy and therapeutics, adverse drug reactions, and adverse drug events, are reviewed in healthcare organizations. The types of medications and the setting in which they are used indicate which medications are high risk, high alert, frequently used, and most vulnerable to underuse, overuse, and misuse. Thousands of drugs are currently on the market. Many are hazardous to use but show beneficial effects for patients. The misuse of opioids is a good example of this; nearly half of all opioid deaths involve a prescription opioid.59 Organizations can identify the drugs they provide in a standard formulary p. 156 p. 157 and identify methods to obtain non-formulary items. Then the use of non-formulary medications is monitored, usually by pharmacy staff, to determine cost-effective, safe medications for administration and ways to integrate new medications into use. High-risk medications include antibiotics, opioids, insulin, anticoagulants, and chemotherapy. High-risk populations may include infants and children, frail older adults, immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients, and transplant recipients. The purpose of medication use monitoring is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medication use and the appropriate use of medication. Because of the frequent use of medications in healthcare, ongoing monitoring is needed. Priorities for monitoring are based on the numbers of patients affected (volume), the degree of risk associated with the drug’s use (risk), the degree to which the medication is known to be problem prone, and other criteria developed by the medical and professional staff. The usual steps in measuring improvement in the phases of the medication process include 1.prescribing appropriate medication; 2.preparing and dispensing medications; 3.administering medications; and 4.monitoring the effects of medications on patients. Perhaps a more recent focus in measuring improvement is on the reconciliation of medications prescribed and taken by the patient. “Medication reconciliation is the process of creating the most accurate list possible of all medications a patient","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_41"}}],["249",{"pageContent":"4.monitoring the effects of medications on patients.

If the medication is high risk, high alert, or non-formulary, was there documentation on usage? It has been acknowledged in recent years that antibiotics have been overused and overprescribed. Various professional and government organizations have developed strategies to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Most recently, a partnership of the NQF, National Quality Partners, and the Antibiotic Stewardship Action Team published a National Quality Partners Playbook: Antibiotic Stewardship in Acute Care.61(p5) It was written to support the call by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2014 to meet the urgent need of improving antibiotic use in hospitals. The core elements of an Antibiotic Stewardship Program include the following: 1.Leadership commitment. Dedicate necessary human, financial, and IT resources. p. 157 p. 158 2.Accountability. Appoint a single leader responsible for program outcomes who is accountable to an executive-level or patient quality-focused hospital committee. 3.Drug expertise. Appoint a single pharmacist leader responsible for working to improve antibiotic use. 4.Action. Implement at least one recommended action. 5.Tracking. Monitor process measures, impact on patients, antibiotic use, and resistance. 6.Reporting. Report information regularly to doctors, nurses and relevant staff. 7.Education. Educate clinicians about disease state management, resistance, and optimal prescribing. Blood and Blood Product Use The administration of blood and blood products is a high-risk aspect of care. Healthcare staff must consider the risk and the therapeutic benefit, including the risk of blood-borne pathogens, transfusion reactions, and transfusion errors. It is also a high-cost item. The key elements to be monitored include ordering, distribution (availability and timeliness of administration), handling and dispensing, administration, and monitoring of the effects on patients. Individual cases are reviewed (TABLE 3-7), and then an evaluation of blood usage practices for providers and the organization can be performed. An evaluation might include blood that is administered when not indicated, not administered when indicated, or administered incorrectly. Specific standards from the College of American Pathologists and the American Association of Blood Banks may be useful for evaluating transfusion services.

Restraints Restraint use is another high-risk procedure that may be used in certain populations. It is no longer allowed in the long-term care setting but may be used in acute hospitals for medical-surgical populations, for inpatient behavioral health populations, and in the emergency department for highly unpredictable patients and situations. Some national and state organizations are calling for the eradication of restraint use in behavioral health settings altogether because of high-profile adverse events related to their use, and the organization’s adoption of trauma-informed principles and practices. Recently developed core measures in inpatient behavioral health include metrics for restraint and seclusion use (The Joint Commission’s Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services [HBIPS]).

The CMS established specific rules related to restraint usage, and these were adopted by The Joint Commission, p. 158 p. 159 which has deemed status with CMS. Deemed status refers to the following: In order for a health care organization to participate in and receive federal payment from Medicare or Medicaid programs, one of the requirements is that a health care organization meet the government requirements for program participation, including a certification of compliance with the health and safety requirements called Conditions of Participation (CoPs) or Conditions for Coverage (CfCs), which are set forth in federal regulations. The certification is achieved based on either a survey conducted by a state agency on behalf of the federal government, such as the CMS, or by a national accrediting organization, such as The Joint Commission, that has been approved by CMS as having standards and a survey process that meets or exceeds Medicare’s requirements. Health care organizations that achieve accreditation through a Joint Commission “deemed status” survey are determined to meet or exceed Medicare and Medicaid requirements.62(p1) The monitoring of this process includes each episode of restraint application (TABLE 3-8). When restraints are used, a checklist is employed to ensure that all required components are met and each episode can be easily monitored using criteria. An aggregate utilization summary allows the organization to determine any trends. Such trends may reveal patterns associated with •time of day or day of week in which restraint use may be higher, such as nights or weekends; •units in which restraint use may be higher, such as geropsychiatric units or units with higher numbers of patients with tubes and other devices; and •providers whose ordering practices reveal higher restraint use.

Operative and Invasive Procedures Operative, invasive, and noninvasive procedures are important diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. They often pose risk to patients and must be monitored systematically (TABLE 3-9). Aspects to be considered for monitoring include •selection of the appropriate procedures; •patient preparation for procedures; •performance of the procedure and patient monitoring; •post-procedure care; •pre-procedure and post-procedure patient education; •pre-procedure and post-procedure diagnostic discrepancies; •moderate sedation monitoring; and •complications or adverse events related to the procedure.

Was the procedure performed in the right setting (e.g., inpatient or outpatient, or in a specialty hospital, or a hospital that performs a high volume of procedures vs. a hospital that infrequently performs a procedure, especially one of high risk and complexity)? Procedures always carry the risk of complications even when performed properly. Risk is greater with procedures performed when not indicated, not performed when indicated, and performed poorly or incorrectly. Outcomes are influenced by clinical performance of all pre-procedure processes; clinical performance of the procedure; and patient monitoring before, during, and after the procedure. p. 159 p. 160 Common errors in the operating room (OR) reported as sentinel events to The Joint Commission include •wrong patient, wrong site, or wrong procedure; •unintended retention of foreign objects; and •operative/postoperative complications.6 Kim et al.58 also identified quality issues in surgery as •breakdown in communication within and among the surgical team, care providers, patients and their families; •delay in diagnosis or failure to diagnose; and •delay in treatment or failure to treat. Several national databases allow comparisons of organizational data with risk-adjusted surgical cases for observed-to-expected ratios of morbidity and mortality. This allows the organization to use an external comparison or benchmark to assess its rate of complications as a trigger or threshold for action (e.g., National Surgical Quality Improvement Program; Chevron Supplier Quality Improvement Process, Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database). Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) monitoring and the outcomes are important to include in any QI program (TABLE 3-10). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is defined as the application of chest compressions, defibrillation, and artificial respirations or rescue breathing. One consideration in CPR monitoring is whether the patient exhibited any signs or symptoms that could have been identified for early intervention before a full arrest occurred. If CPR must be performed, there are specific guidelines on chest compressions, airway maintenance and breathing, defibrillation, and medications (i.e., American Heart Association).

Were there early warning signs for rapid response team (RRT) to intervene before full arrest? RRT may be monitored separately for outcomes. Morbidity and Mortality Review of morbidity and mortality is often based on specific criteria. For mortality, a review of expected or unexpected mortality (observed vs. expected) is performed by condition, within specific time frames (e.g., immediately in the OR, in the hospital setting, or within 30 days after discharge), and based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, patients are usually excluded from review who are expected to die based on a terminal condition with a Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate/Allow Natural Death orders, who are in hospice, or who have an end-stage condition. Other mortalities are p. 160 p. 161 then reviewed as outcomes that can provide information about the quality of care provided. Similarly, complications are also reviewed, and the criteria for cases and conditions to be reviewed are established by the medical and professional staff.

Infection Prevention, Surveillance, and Control The goal of the infection prevention and control (IPC) program is to identify and reduce the risks of acquiring and transmitting endemic and epidemic infections among patients, employees, physicians, other IPC professionals, contractors, volunteers, students, and visitors. This includes both direct patient care and support staff. The three major aspects of the IPC program are surveillance, prevention, and control. The usual responsibilities of the IPC program include •definitions of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); •definitions of data elements; •rationale for surveillance method selected; •description of patient population studied; •data collection methods; p. 161 p. 162 •quality control procedures for data validation; •responsibility; •systems for reporting","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_49"}}],["257",{"pageContent":"•definitions of data elements; •rationale for surveillance method selected; •description of patient population studied; •data collection methods; p. 161 p. 162 •quality control procedures for data validation; •responsibility; •systems for reporting and follow-up; •reporting to public health authorities; and •documentation of employee infections of epidemiologic significance. The prevention and control methods used in IPC include •policies and procedures to protect and prevent infections; •defined barrier precautions; •orientation and ongoing education of staff; •reporting to public health officials; •methods for screening and documentation of epidemiologically significant infections; •systems for required waste identification; •use of personal protective equipment and supplies: ⚬patient care supplies and equipment (e.g., sterile and nonsterile supplies, hand hygiene facilities), ⚬protective apparel, and ⚬engineering controls; •precautions used to reduce the risk of infection: ⚬surveillance, and ⚬assessment and analysis of infection rates; •decontamination, high-level disinfection, and sterilization: ⚬reusable medical equipment, ⚬policies and procedures, and ⚬processes identified: ▪principles of asepsis; ▪disinfection, sterilization; ▪sanitation of rooms, equipment; ▪selection, use, and cleaning of personal protective equipment; and ▪traffic control. The IPC program is based on a risk assessment of the organization. This assessment includes factors such as •geographic location of the organization; •populations within the region or organization and level of risk (e.g., neonates, infants, and children, and patients in various intensive care units [ICUs]); •volume of patients served and volume of conditions (e.g., number of patients with positive human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]); •clinical focus of programs (e.g., types of surgeries and invasive procedures, immunocompromised patients such as patients on chemotherapy, transplant patients); •number of employees (often encompasses employee occupational health services); and •scope of services provided (e.g., acute, ambulatory, long-term, and home care).

After the risk assessment is completed, priorities are identified and strategies to prevent or mitigate problems are determined. In many healthcare settings, the prevention of HAIs in high-risk units (ICU, neonatal and pediatric ICU, transplant units, dialysis units, and surgical units) is a key responsibility. These HAIs must be monitored and analyzed to determine trends and ways to reduce their occurrence. The types of surveillance for IPC programs include total house, priority directed, targeted, problem oriented, and outbreak response. The most important factor in monitoring prevention of HAIs is proper hand hygiene. The monitoring of hand hygiene using either CDC or World Health Organization criteria is a requirement of The Joint Commission and a National Patient Safety Goal. Specific monitoring is performed for surgical-site infections and for device-related infections including ventilator-associated pneumonia, CLABSI, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Another key role is to identify communicable diseases, control outbreaks when identified in patients, and report specific results to the public health department. One preventive measure for controlling certain outbreaks is immunization programs conducted in collaboration with occupational health staff. These might include vaccination for hepatitis B, influenza, pneumonia, and other viral diseases. The infection preventionist is also responsible for monitoring epidemiologically important and multidrug-resistant organisms such as MRSA, Clostridium difficile, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Tools are being developed for collecting data to monitor these high-risk areas for causing adverse events or harm to patients. As conditions or areas of concern for quality and patient safety are identified, healthcare quality professionals need to stay informed of new knowledge, trends, and tools to address infection risk to patients. The models described for specific conditions can be utilized to address key questions about interventions and measures specific to the condition. Medical Records/Electronic Health Records The monitoring of the medical record/electronic health record usually includes elements in several categories: •Required documentation content: The requirements vary by setting, procedure, and even profession. For example, the requirements for a treatment plan/individualized plan of care is different for an acute care hospital and a long-term care facility. The requirements for surgery with general anesthesia are different from those for an outpatient procedure with moderate sedation. Each facility must first identify the required content for the record and then develop a process to monitor important elements. Checklists, databases, or other tools make this process more efficient.

This step often reflects the presence or absence of the required content. •Timeliness of documentation: The next requirement is the time requirement of specific documentation. Most common elements monitored for timeliness include history and physical, preoperative and postoperative notes, p. 162 p. 163 and discharge summaries. This step reflects whether the documentation met or did not meet the required timeline. •Appropriateness of documentation (clinical pertinence): The monitoring of clinical pertinence requires an assessment of the documentation in terms of the patient’s condition, diagnostic results, intervention procedures, vital signs, and other information. This review may determine that documentation was appropriate or not appropriate to the standard of care, key elements of the assessment, treatment plan, interventions, and medication management. Medical Peer Review Peer review is an evaluation of an episode of care conducted to improve the quality of patient care or the use of healthcare resources. It is a process protected by statute in most states, although this varies, and by federal statute for federal healthcare facilities. While the protection by statute may vary, the confidentiality of the reviewer and those under review is critical to ensuring the integrity of the process. Healthcare quality professionals often coordinate and facilitate the medical review process on behalf of the medical and professional staff and are responsible for maintaining confidentiality throughout the process. The first step is to identify an appropriate peer for the specific review. A peer is generally defined as a healthcare professional with comparable education, training, experience, licensure, or similar clinical privileges or scope of practice. The peer review process includes a criteria-based case review. The medical and professional staff establish the criteria. These reviews may include an assessment of the degree to which a standard was met or if providers in the same situation would act in the same manner. These ratings may be noted as a score or level number for tracking purposes or as a trigger for Focused Professional Practice Evaluation when continued quality concerns are identified. Results may be trended by individual provider performance or by organization system. Usually, a peer review committee manages the review and reporting function as a subcommittee of the medical executive committee.

An effective peer review process includes these elements: •Consistency: Peer review is conducted using defined procedures. •Defensibility: Conclusions reached through the process are supported by a rationale. •Balance: Minority opinions and views of the person being reviewed are considered and recorded. •Peer review activities are considered in the reappointment process. •Conclusions from peer review are tracked over time. •Actions based on conclusions are monitored for effectiveness. •Findings, conclusions, recommendations, and actions are communicated to appropriate entities. •Recommendations to improve performance are implemented. Physician leaders have a role in improving clinical processes used for clinical privileging. Practitioner profiles are extremely important to maintain and are used to evaluate performance and maintain privileges. Some key aspects of these files include the following: •Profiles are based on performance. •Profiles are provided to each physician or provider on a regular basis. •Organizations may use risk-adjusted software. •EBP determines metrics used. •Data are timely and accurate. •Profiles are process focused. •Physician data are grouped by specialty type or specific diagnoses. •Data are reported regularly. •Physician champions talk directly with medical staff about their data. The physician data must be meaningful to physicians. Data represent major service lines and patient safety issues and include inpatient as well as outpatient data. When available, national targets and benchmarks are used to compare performance. For example, national rates of complications of certain procedures when compared with a specific physician or service can help the organization identify performance concerns about what is expected for the same procedure. Data are easily accessed and shared with the physician to improve performance; the profiles vary by the physician’s specialty or area of practice. Some examples of elements that might be found in a physician profile or the Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE). These might include patient volume, length of stay, conformity with system wide initiatives (e.g., use of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism prophylaxis), legibility of records and use of unapproved abbreviations, and severity-adjusted","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_53"}}],["261",{"pageContent":"might include patient volume, length of stay, conformity with system wide initiatives (e.g., use of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism prophylaxis), legibility of records and use of unapproved abbreviations, and severity-adjusted morbidity or mortality rates.

More information on data analysis and SPC are described in Health Data Analytics. Affinity Diagram The affinity diagram (FIG. 3-12) organizes numerous ideas or issues into groupings based on their natural relationships within the groupings. These diagrams typically are used to analyze or chart a process and to structure and organize issues to provide a new perspective. How to construct 1.Define the issue. 2.Brainstorm and record ideas on cards. 3.Randomly display the cards on a board. 4.Have the group silently sort the issues into groups. 5.Create header cards for groupings. 6.Draw a diagram based on the groupings (it will look like an organizational chart). When to use •To analyze or chart a process •To structure and organize issues to provide a new perspective Figure 3-12 Affinity diagram. Brainstorming Brainstorming (FIG. 3-13) is a free-flowing generation of ideas. This approach can generate excitement, equalize involvement, and result in original solutions to the problem. There is no censoring or discussion of ideas as they are generated, but the team can build upon the ideas of others.

How to construct 1.Define the brainstorming topic. 2.Inform participants of the ground rules that (a) “all ideas are good ideas” and (b) “all comments/evaluation should be held in abeyance until the brainstorming is complete.” 3.Give everyone a few minutes to think about the topic and write down their ideas. 4.Have the team members call out their ideas. This can be free-flowing, or a structure can be used, such as going around the table with each person verbalizing one idea each time around. 5.As the ideas are generated, one person should write the ideas on a flip chart.

The checklist ensures accuracy, accountability, completeness, and efficiency. Some ways to organize a checklist include the following: How to construct 1.Identify critical elements or tasks to be completed for a process. 2.Make a list of all elements with a space to indicate completion of the task before moving to the next item. When to use •When reliance on memory is not sufficient •When tasks for a process or activity are critical and omission may cause harm Figure 3-15 Checklist. •Ordered List: a list of tasks needed to be accomplished in a particular order. The checklist is numbered, starting at the first task or step, and proceeding to the last task or step, in increasing numerical order. The ordered list ensures correct and complete processing. •Itemized List: a list of items to be addressed, with meaningful information alongside; used as a guide or reference. An itemized list provides a complete accounting or reporting of the information present. •Sub-List: a sub-list is a branch or subset of an ordered list. Sub-lists can exist for almost any of the above types of lists. •Prioritized List: any of the above lists placed into an order based on a priority scheme. It helps use time effectively, focus energy where it’s most needed, and address the important items or tasks first. •General List: any of the above lists with a space for a check mark, initials, or additional information. As tasks or items are completed, the line is checked or initialed.66 Deployment Chart or Planning Grid A deployment chart (FIG. 3-16) is used to project schedules for complex tasks and their associated subtasks.

Delphi Method The Delphi method is a combination of the brainstorming, multivoting, and nominal group techniques. This technique is used when group members are not in one location and often is conducted by e-mail when a meeting is not feasible. After each step in the process, the data are sent to one person, who compiles the data and sends out the next round for participants to complete. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a preventive approach to identify failures and opportunities for error and can be used for processes as well as equipment. The traditional techniques for FMEA originated in manufacturing and other industries and were adapted to healthcare. The Veterans Affairs National Center for Patient Safety created the Healthcare FMEATM (HFMEA). There are six main steps to HFMEA, as displayed in FIGURE 3-17.

Figure 3-17 Healthcare failure mode and effects analysis. Flow Chart or Process Flow Chart The flow chart or process flow chart (FIG. 3-18) is a graphical display of a process as it is known to its authors, owners, or team. The flow chart outlines the sequence and relationship of the pieces of the process. Through management of data and information, the team comes to a common understanding and knowledge concerning the process. Information is discussed about the structure (who carries out the specific step in the identified process), the activity that is occurring, and the outcome or the results. How to construct 1.Define the process that will be represented in the flowchart. 2.Determine all individuals, departments and groups involved in the process. 3.Brainstorm the steps in the process. 4.Construct the flowchart graphically using rows or columns corresponding to the associated work units. 5.Arrange the steps sequentially. 6.Draw arrows between the steps to show the process flow. 7.Review the flowchart and validate its accuracy with other individuals who are involved in the process. When to use •To show steps in a process •To find one or multiple sources of a problem or identify potential areas for improvement •To examine the handoffs that occur in a process •To identify personnel, groups, or entire departments that are responsible for processes or tasks •To demonstrate current processes (current state) Figure 3-18 Flowchart or process flowchart.

Interrelationship Diagram This tool organizes numerous complex problems, issues, or ideas by sorting and displaying their interrelations. The interrelationship diagram (FIG. 3-19) requires multidirectional thinking when there is not a straight-line cause-and-effect relationship. It is useful to address both operational and organizational issues. How to construct 1.Determine the issue/problem. 2.Generate ideas through brainstorming and other methods regarding the steps in the processes or issues. 3.Write the steps on cards and arrange them in similar groups (as with the affinity diagram) in cause-and-effect sequence. This technique is most effective when dealing with 15–50 items that may be interrelated. Discussion is appropriate throughout this process to ensure that no steps are missed. 4.Allow at least ½-inch of space between the cards so that relationship arrows can be drawn. 5.Fill in the relationship arrows that indicate what leads to what. This is done one card at a time until all cards have been discussed and relationship arrows drawn. Each card should be examined in terms of what happens when this card (process step) occurs; two-way arrows should be avoided. 6.Review and revise the diagram, transfer the information to a sheet of paper, and distribute it to team members for their review and revision before the next meeting. 7.Identify cards with the most arrows leading to them and cards with the most arrows leading away from them. Cards with incoming arrows represent a secondary issue or bottleneck in a process. Cards with outgoing arrows indicate a basic cause/issue that, if solved or overcome, will affect many other items. Cards with the most arrows are key factors in the process and should be addressed first. When to use •When the correct sequencing of events is critical •When the issue/problem is complex and contains interrelationships among and between ideas/steps Figure 3-19 Interrelationship diagram.

Figure 3-20 Matrix diagram. Multivoting Multivoting (FIG. 3-21) is an easy, quick method for determining the most popular or important items from a list. The method uses a series of votes to cut the list in half each time, thus reducing the number of items to be considered. How to construct 1.Generate a list of items and number them. 2.If the group agrees, combine items that seem to be similar. 3.If necessary, renumber all items. 4.Each member lists on a sheet of paper the items he or she considers the most important (the number of items chosen should be at least one-third of the total number of items on the list). 5.Tally the votes beside each item on the list. 6.Eliminate items with the lowest scores. 7.Repeat the above process until the list is narrowed down to an appropriate number for the group to focus on or the item with the top priority is identified. When to use Use after a brainstorming session to identify the key items on which the group will focus Figure 3-21 Multivoting. Nominal Group Technique This is a group decision-making process for generating many ideas in which each member works by himself or herself. The nominal group technique (FIG. 3-22) is used when group members are new to each other or when they have different opinions and goals. This approach is more structured than brainstorming and multivoting. How to construct 1.Define the task as you would for brainstorming. 2.Describe the purpose of this technique and the process to the group. 3.Write the question to be answered for all to see. Be sure to clarify the question as needed for the group. 4.Generate ideas to address the identified question by having the group write down their ideas in silence. 5.List all the items as you would in brainstorming.

Prioritization Matrix This tool organizes tasks, issues, or actions and prioritizes them based on agreed-upon criteria. The tool combines the tree diagram and the L-shaped matrix diagram, displaying the best possible effect. The prioritization matrix (FIG. 3-24) often is used before more complex matrices are needed. This matrix applies options under discussion to the priority considerations of the organization. How to construct 1.Create an L-shaped matrix as previously described in the matrix section. 2.Prioritize and assign weights to the list of criteria that will be used in the prioritization. 3.Prioritize the list of options based on each criterion. 4.Prioritize and select the item(s) across all the criteria. When to use •When issues are identified and options must be narrowed down •When options have strong interrelationships •When options all need to be done, but prioritization or sequencing is needed Figure 3-24 Prioritization matrix. p. 168 p. 169 Process Decision Program Chart This tool maps the identified events and contingencies that can occur between the time a problem is stated and solved.

Root Cause Analysis When variation is inherent in the process and a reduction of the variation is desired, the root cause of the variation must be identified to eliminate tampering with the effective components of the process. The Joint Commission requires a root cause analysis (RCA) in response to sentinel events (unexpected serious adverse events). 1.To start with, identify potential causes of the variation. An interdisciplinary team very familiar with the process can use brainstorming, flowcharting, cause-and-effect diagrams, or some other process to determine these potential causes. 2.The second step is to verify the potential causes by collecting data about the process. After the data are collected and analyzed using the tools discussed in this module, the actual causes of the variation (or at least the most probable causes) can be identified.

The project sponsor checks in periodically on the team’s progress. What is a team? A team is “a group of people who are interdependent with respect to information, resources, and skills and who seek to combine their efforts to achieve a common goal.”72(p2) An important structural element for healthcare quality is creating a team-based organization. Because patient care involves multiple professional disciplines, the linchpin for improvement is an employee base with regular communication and contact that allows them to coordinate and problem solve to continuously improve quality of care. The organization must develop an infrastructure within which the cycle of improvement can operate. One feature of this infrastructure is teams. Teamwork in healthcare is “a dynamic process involving two or more health professionals with complimentary backgrounds and skills, sharing common health goals and exercising concerted physical and mental effort in assessing, planning, or evaluating patient care. This is accomplished through interdependent collaboration, open communication and shared decision-making. This in turn generates value-added patient, organizational and staff outcomes.”73(p238) Nancarrow et al.74 identified 10 competencies of effective inter-professional teams: 1.Identifies a leader who establishes a clear direction and vision for the team, while listening and providing support and supervision to the team members. 2.Incorporates a set of values that clearly provide direction for the team’s service provision; these values should be visible and consistently portrayed. 3.Demonstrates a team culture and interdisciplinary atmosphere of trust where contributions are valued and consensus is fostered. 4.Ensures appropriate processes and infrastructures are in place to uphold the vision of the service (e.g., referral criteria, communications infrastructure). 5.Provides quality patient-focused services with documented outcomes; utilizes feedback to improve the quality of care. 6.Utilizes communication strategies that promote intra-team communication, collaborative decision-making and effective team processes. 7.Provides sufficient team staffing to integrate an appropriate mix of skills, competencies, and personalities to meet the needs of patients and enhance smooth functioning. 8.Facilitates recruitment of staff who demonstrate interdisciplinary competencies including team functioning, collaborative leadership, communication, and sufficient professional knowledge and experience. 9.Promotes role interdependence while respecting individual roles and autonomy. 10.Facilitates personal development through appropriate training, rewards, recognition, and","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_68"}}],["276",{"pageContent":"competencies including team functioning, collaborative leadership, communication, and sufficient professional knowledge and experience. 9.Promotes role interdependence while respecting individual roles and autonomy. 10.Facilitates personal development through appropriate training, rewards, recognition, and opportunities for career development.74(pp5–11) Types of Teams High-functioning teams improve clinical and financial outcomes. The roles that team members assume in the provision of patient care vary depending on philosophical, political, social, communication, and clinical differences about patient care.75 Inarguably, teams are of great importance. And there are many types of formal and informal teams. •Temporary project: Teams with a special focus on improvement, problem solving, or product development. There are often both core and resource members. Core members participate throughout the project and have complementary skills needed for the desired work output. Resource members may be critical only for specific phases of the project and may move in and out of the team. Other ongoing or functional work teams are usually permanent or may be longstanding. •Natural work: These teams involve the people in each work setting who share responsibility for a process, workflow, or type of work. Members are those who work together each day to complete the task. These teams can be cross-functional, as with an OR team, or intact, such as a team of nurses in a unit. Autonomy varies, but there typically is a leader. These teams can be temporary (e.g., brought together to solve a single problem) or permanent (e.g., continuous improvement teams). •Self-directed: This work team is a type of natural work team that shares many management responsibilities, such as scheduling work, managing budgets, evaluating performance, and hiring new team members. •Process management: Team focuses on sharing responsibility for monitoring and controlling a work process, such as new product development. Members may rotate on and off the team based on their contributions (expertise). •Virtual teams: Team typically uses technology-supported communications rather than face-to-face interactions to accomplish their tasks. They may cross boundaries, such as time zones, geography, and organizational units. Virtual teams can be either project teams or ongoing teams. p. 177 p. 178 Steering Committees Steering committees (often known as quality councils) are permanent QI teams consisting of cross-functional members, and in patient-centered care environments, include patients and family members.

These committees are self-managed teams that provide direction and focus by identifying and prioritizing improvement opportunities in the organization. The role of the steering committee or quality council is to sustain, facilitate, and expand the performance and process improvement initiatives based on the strategic plan. It is comprised of top leaders in the organization, including medical staff. The main responsibilities of the quality council include •lending legitimacy to the quality efforts; •maintaining organization focus on the identified goals and priorities; •fostering teamwork for improvement; •providing necessary resources (e.g., human, financial); and •formulating organizational policies regarding quality and safety priorities, participation, annual self-assessments, and reward and recognition systems. When to Use Teams Three aspects of the required task are examined before deciding whether to use a team: task complexity, task interdependence, and task objectives.76 Tasks are complex when they involve large amounts of information, they are performed under conditions of high uncertainty, they contain many subtasks that require people with specialized skills and knowledge, and there are no standardized procedures for completing the tasks. Teams are important because they bring larger numbers of specialized individuals (i.e., subject matter experts) to carry the burden and offer greater diverse inputs that are more likely to result in more alternatives generated and more creative solutions. Creativity is particularly important when there are no standardized procedures and the environment is uncertain. Task interdependence means that the work of one person is highly dependent on the work of others. Patient care typically involves a multitude of disciplines that must coordinate their work, and this requires intense communication. Teams therefore are appropriate, because this type of structure can foster communication between the various disciplines. Finally, teams are appropriate to use when the task objectives are clear and time-bound. One approach for making task objectives clear is to develop a team charter. The charter contains the following information77: •Description of the process, why it needs improvement, and who is affected; •Development of criteria to demonstrate that the process improved; •Timeline for meetings; •Resources available; •Structure of leadership (e.g., self-managed, leader-directed); and •Expected communication of progress and results.

How Teams Develop and Grow Teams develop, mature, and change over time. Tuckman78 described four stages of development in one popular model with somewhat predictable stages. This classic framework continues to be used to this day. Stage 1. Forming. During the first stage, the members try to get to know each other, agree on the goal or vision, and delegate tasks. They cautiously explore boundaries to determine acceptable group behavior. Discussions focus on how to accomplish the tasks and the information and resources needed, and the team accomplishes little at this stage. This is a period of testing to find out what kind of behavior is appropriate. Members tend to defer to the leader or dominant member for guidance. In this stage, team leaders need to be directive and provide role clarification. Members get to know each other, agree on goals, and delegate tasks; members may feel anxiety, excitement, and uncertainty, and they may test boundaries of behavior. The team leader needs to be directive, with high-task relationships, and provide role clarification. The team depends on the leader during this learning stage. This stage is short if the tasks are clearly defined and easily achievable. Stage 2. Storming. This second stage is where conflict typically arises. Members try to express their individuality and resist group pressures and influence. There often are emotional responses to group demands, especially if the group is under pressure to achieve results. To prevent the group from becoming stuck at this stage, leaders need to manage the conflict, not by suppressing it but by using it to energize the team. Conflict and tension often arise, and members assert their individual roles and compete for control. The leader moves to a coaching style of leadership. At this stage, reality sets in. There is the realization that the task may be difficult, they notice their lack of progress, and there is resistance to the task. Resources are applied to the task rather than education about the problem. People are willing to suggest tasks, and the leader then delegates the tasks. People do not take responsibility for problems, yet the team is building cohesion. This is probably the most difficult stage. Arguing, defensiveness, disunity, and tension are often evident. Stage 3. Norming. In this stage, members develop close ties and a strong identity with the team. There is a shift from “I” to “we” and a willingness to accept the views of others","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_71"}}],["279",{"pageContent":"and tension are often evident.

Team p. 178 p. 179 members develop feelings of mutual respect, harmony, and trust. Group standards and members’ roles emerge. Leaders need to challenge the team members to continue to grow and guard against too much conformity to group norms. The team develops close ties and a strong identity; members develop harmony by avoiding conflict. Tentative constructive criticism is allowed. A supporting leadership style evolves. Concern moves from silos to the inter-professional group. Members volunteer evidence-based solutions instead of just providing vague suggestions. There is an emerging leadership or ownership of functional roles by the members. There is acceptance of team rules, norms, and roles and finally optimism that things work out. More harmony, cohesion, and discussion of team dynamics occur. Stage 4. Performing. In the fourth stage, the team works harmoniously toward a common goal and is very productive. The team develops a functional but flexible structure, and roles are interrelated. Interpersonal conflicts are resolved, and the group is highly task oriented. In this stage, the leader needs to develop mechanisms for sharing leadership responsibilities. The team works harmoniously and gains insight into the team’s process. Improvement of the team’s process and team identification begins to predominate. The team is task oriented and accomplishes its work. Goal orientation is now optimized, and task competency is high. High morale, support, and appreciation come from team members. Roles diminish, and participation by all is encouraged. The team may begin to take on additional responsibilities and is functioning at an optimal level. Not all teams progress through these four stages, and if they do, they probably move back and forth through the stages as new issues are identified or new members join the team. Nevertheless, the stages point to important developmental issues having implications for team leaders, facilitators, and coaches. Lack of effectiveness often results from leadership and facilitation problems and a lack of clear goals and expectations.

To identify these personnel, consider all relevant stakeholders to the process. The ideal team size is 8–12 people. Unless necessary, team size should not exceed 15 people. They can collect data and information related to the process of focus. For the stakeholders not represented, develop a communication mechanism (team minutes, session report) and designate one or more people to disseminate this information regularly. Chosen team members must be able to commit to attend team meetings and meet their responsibilities. Scribe The scribe role may be assigned to one person or rotated between members. The role includes documenting minutes of meetings and other recordkeeping activities. p. 179 p. 180 Characteristics of Effective Teams It is widely known that teams often fail to produce the results for which they were brought together. What makes a team successful? Abundant research and practice demonstrate the important predictors of team success80–82: •Competent members with technical, problem-solving, interpersonal, and organizational skills; •Commitment to clear, common goals; •Standards of excellence; •Contributions from every member; •Collaborative environment (culture to support teamwork); •Leadership support; •Nonhierarchical structure; and •External support and recognition. Characteristics of effective and ineffective teams are further described in TABLE 3-12. Four key traits can predict a team’s success: (1) Cohesiveness; (2) Communication; (3) Clear roles; and (4) Clear goals.79 Table 3-12 Team Characteristics Effective Teams Ineffective Teams Mutual agreement and identification with respect to the team goal Open communication between members Mutual trust and support Management of human differences Selective use of the team Appropriate member skills Leadership Values and goals of the members interpreted as needs and values","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_74"}}],["282",{"pageContent":"Characteristics Effective Teams Ineffective Teams Mutual agreement and identification with respect to the team goal Open communication between members Mutual trust and support Management of human differences Selective use of the team Appropriate member skills Leadership Values and goals of the members interpreted as needs and values of the team Team believes it can accomplish the impossible Understands the value of constructive team cohesiveness and how to use it Mutual influence between members and the leader Exhibits clear goals, purposes, discussions, and decisions Agrees on the goal Has formally defined roles Revises plan as needed Uses tool to map the process and project steps Effectively uses talents of members Balances participation of all members Discusses issues openly Clarifies ideas or issues Uses consensus-based decision-making Uses data for problem solving Applies resources and training throughout the project Does not distinguish between facts, opinions, and feelings Does not separate idea generation from idea evaluation Prematurely closes discussion before all alternatives are identified Dominated by aggressive members Fails to assign specific responsibilities Does not review minutes, tasks, or due dates Works on problems that are outside the scope of the team Exhibits uncertainty about the team’s direction Launches many improvement projects without clear objectives Fails to apply discussion skills Hides a secret agenda Relies on one person to manage discussion without sharing responsibility Discusses the project outside the meeting rather than bringing issues to the team Repeats points of discussion Concedes to opinions rather than fact-based data Uses majority rule rather than consensus in disagreements Uses decision by default, with silence assumed as consent Avoids certain topics Does not acknowledge ground rules Has recurring differences on acceptable behavior Has conflicting expectations Does not attend to clues or shifts in the team mood Makes remarks that discount someone’s behavior or contribution Cohesiveness is the social glue that binds the team members together as a unit. Cohesiveness can be increased by the establishment of ground rules, or norms, addressing how meetings are run, how team members interact, and what kind of behavior is acceptable. Each member is expected to respect these rules, which usually prevents misunderstandings and disagreements. Balanced participation is encouraged to strengthen the team’s cohesion. Because every team member has a stake in the achievements, everyone participates in discussions and decisions, shares the commitment to the project’s success, and contributes their talents.

When a team is cohesive, members are attracted to the team; find membership in the team to be a personally meaningful experience; enjoy the company of the other team members; support, nurture, and care for each other; feel free to share ideas and suggest ways to improve team function; feel they are using their unique skills for the benefit of the team; have a strong “we” feeling; and routinely develop creative solutions to problems. Communication is the next key component to successful teams. Communication involves a full range of topics, including decision-making and problem solving. Effective communication becomes easier once the team develops a certain level of cohesiveness. Communication is key because further team development and effective functioning cannot occur without team communication. When a team is communicating effectively, team members •freely say what they feel and think; •are always direct, truthful, respectful, and positive; •openly discuss all decisions before they are made; •handle conflict in a calm, caring, and healing manner; •openly explore options to solve problems when they arise; and •do not gossip about each other, have unknown alliances, or hidden agendas. Effective, clear communication depends on how information is exchanged between team members. Ideally, team members speak clearly, directly, and succinctly. They ask questions in an inviting way. Members listen actively and avoid interrupting when others are speaking. The team encourages all members to use the skills and practices that make discussions and meetings more effective. Team members initiate discussions, seek information and opinions, suggest procedures, elaborate on ideas, complete assignments on time, and summarize. Team leaders and facilitators act as gatekeepers during communication by managing member participation, keeping discussion focused, and resolving differences creatively. Considering the stage of team development, such as storming, leaders and facilitators may need to ease tension and work through difficulties. Communication also includes well-defined decision-making procedures. p. 180 p. 181 The role of champion can greatly benefit engagement in a quality or safety effort.

Physician champions are especially effective in improving physician engagement in quality and safety efforts. Champions are also critical for successful teams in healthcare settings. They can contribute to the success of projects, innovations and other organizational change initiatives. A team is always aware of the different ways it reaches consensus. The team discusses how decisions are made, explore important issues by polling, test for agreement, and use data as the basis for decisions. Occasionally, the team may want to designate a member to observe team interactions and give feedback on how decisions are made so the group can talk about any changes it needs to make. Team members are also sensitive to nonverbal communication. This includes seeing, hearing, and feeling the team dynamics. Role clarity is the next area to facilitate team success. The roles are common among teams but they may differ slightly depending on the type of team that is convened. The role of team member supersedes individual professional roles. Although professional roles brought to the team give the team its potential strength, it is also important for team development that individuals feel equally valued. In addition, team members know who is doing what and what other team members expect of them. When a team achieves role clarity, members feel that accomplishments of the team are placed above those of individuals, understand the roles and responsibilities of all other team members, and there is a clear understanding of what other team members expect of them. A team facilitator is clearly identified. Facilitation requires skills that are both art and science. A skilled facilitator guides group process in an unbiased manner ensuring that the meeting agenda is carried out and decisions are responsibly reached with independent contributions from all team members. The final component of team development to become a fully functioning and high-performing team is clearly defining team goals and the means used to reach these goals. When a team achieves goal clarity, team members agree on what the p. 181 p. 182 real work of the team is, clearly understand the goals, agree on how to reach the goals, and agree on clear criteria for evaluating the outcomes of the team.

Successful teams are one of the most important aspects of effective organizational functioning and quality, safety and PI efforts. Two special team types have patient safety as their focus but include essential elements of teams that increase their ability to address patient safety and error reduction. The first is Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS®), a teamwork system designed for healthcare professionals. This is an evidence-based teamwork system designed to improve communication and teamwork skills. Team members learn four primary teamwork skills: leadership, communication, situation monitoring, and mutual support. Three types of team outcomes are desired: performance, knowledge, and attitudes. The TeamSTEPPS model is based on lessons learned, change models, the literature of quality and patient safety, and culture change. Phase 1 assesses an organization’s readiness for undertaking the initiative. Phase 2 includes planning, training, and implementation; options in this phase include tools and strategies. Phase 3 sustains and spreads improvements in teamwork performance, clinical processes, and outcomes.83 See the section Patient Safety for more information on TeamSTEPPS. The second special type of team is Crew Resource Management (CRM). A specific CRM training program based on airline safety was developed for healthcare. Although the team is focused on patient safety, the effectiveness of team functioning is a first critical component.84 Additional elements include a focus on the patient safety mindset and high-reliability functioning. The team learns skills in decision-making under stressful situations through continued practice, simulation, and use of checklists to embed teamwork behaviors into daily work and provide numerous opportunities to practice the desired behaviors. For those organizations employing Six Sigma or Lean methods, a Workout is a fast track change acceleration process developed originally at General Electric. The Workout is conducted by a group of team members in a short time (hours or days).85 With well-defined team roles and clear direction defined in a challenge statement and goal the Workout is a good example of the effective use of teams for rapid PI. This process has also been called Rapid Process Improvement Workshop in some organizations. Evaluating Team Performance Evaluating team performance is important to the overall effectiveness of an organization’s operations and improvement efforts.

Team performance also requires formal evaluation. In general, evaluation of a team includes three criteria: 1.Productivity or results: The extent to which the goals were met. Did the team accomplish what it set out to do and within the defined time frame? 2.Satisfaction of team members: It is important that team members can work together in the future. To the extent that members are satisfied with the team, they are more likely to work well together in the future. 3.Individual growth: The extent to which individual members developed professionally by serving as team members. A more formalized manner of evaluating team performance includes the following process criteria: •Organizational alignment: ⚬Does the team have statements of mission, vision, values, structures, roles, and goals? ⚬Does the team have a charter? Are the purpose and goals important to the organization’s strategic priorities? •Goal clarity: Are there clearly stated goals, and do actions exist to achieve the goals? •Leadership: Is there clear leadership support of the team? •Roles: Are team roles been defined? •Norms: Does the team define ground rules and abide by them? •Team participation: Do all members of the team participate and share tasks? •Team meetings: Are team meetings organized with agendas, time frames, action plans, and decisions? •Competency to perform tasks: Are members trained to work on tasks? •Communication: Is communication open, honest, and constructive? •Atmosphere: Is the atmosphere warm, accepting, and supportive for all team members? •Decision-making: Does the team achieve consensus on decisions and look at multiple alternatives before reaching a decision? •Problem solving: Is the team able to validate problem identification before moving to a solution by using sound data and tools? •Conflicts: Does the team have a process for constructively managing interpersonal conflict? p. 182 p. 183 •Performance management: Does the team manage its performance, or must management intervene? •Work tools and training: Has the team been trained on tools and data management to function effectively? •Boundary management: Has the team developed relationships with other teams, stakeholders, and customers?

Healthcare quality professionals play an important role in leading or facilitating PI projects. Many different types of improvement projects may be chartered. They vary in breadth, scope, and duration. There are also different names that may be assigned to projects, but they all can be categorized under the umbrella of quality and safety. For example, there may be rapid process improvement teams, green belt project teams, black belt project teams, Lean projects, Six Sigma projects, and redesign projects. They are similar in their basic approach. The types of tools and level of statistical analysis may vary by type of team. Depending on the complexity of the project, a simple action plan may be sufficient, or the use of a Gantt or Program Evaluation Review Technique chart for project management might be more helpful.

Aligning Incentives to Advance Quality Reward systems are critical to the success of quality, safety and PI initiatives. In fact, “The most damaging alignment problem to which many total quality failures have been attributed is the lack of alignment between expectations that arise from total quality change processes and reward systems.”86(p362) Rewards are important because they can motivate people. Motivating people to provide excellent customer service is a top priority for most organizations. Therefore, before discussing rewards, it is important to understand motivation. Basics of Motivation Work motivation is “the psychological forces that determine the direction of a person’s behavior in an organization, a person’s level of effort, and a person’s level of persistence.”87(p181) There are many theories of motivation and each has somewhat different but complementary implications for actions that motivate employees. Therefore, a basic understanding of major theories is important. Need Theories. Need theories center on what employees are motivated to obtain from work (outcomes). These theories include Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, McClelland’s need theory, and Hertzberg’s two-factor theory. Maslow’s88 need theory was first published in 1943. Maslow, a psychologist, believed that human needs could be arranged in a hierarchy from the most basic to higher order needs, as follows: •Physiologic or survival needs (basic survival needs such as food and water); •Safety or security needs (protection from harm or physical deprivation); •Belongingness or social needs (the need for interaction with others, companionship, belonging, and friendship); p. 183 p. 184 •Esteem or status needs (needs for recognition and appreciation); and •self-actualization needs (the need for self-fulfillment or to reach one’s highest potential). Maslow believed that basic needs had","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_81"}}],["289",{"pageContent":"183 p. 184 •Esteem or status needs (needs for recognition and appreciation); and •self-actualization needs (the need for self-fulfillment or to reach one’s highest potential). Maslow believed that basic needs had to be met before higher order needs. For example, basic survival needs are met (e.g., working in a safe environment) before employees focus on esteem needs. In addition, Maslow maintained that only unsatisfied needs served to motivate people; people want what they do not have. McClelland proposed a concept like Maslow’s, narrowing the number of needs to three types: achievement, power, and affiliation.89 Finally, Herzberg’s two-factor theory classified the elements of motivation into two categories: motivators and hygiene factors.90 Motivators are the elements of a job that increase job satisfaction, including challenging work, achievement, recognition, growth, and advancement. Hygiene factors, on the other hand, do not contribute to motivation, but their absence leads to dissatisfaction. Hygiene factors include company policy and administrative issues such as supervision, working conditions, interpersonal relations, safety, salaries, morale, and productivity. Herzberg expanded on Maslow’s theory, making a distinction between factors that motivate and factors that maintain motivation. At least two managerial implications for motivation are clear from need theories: •There are many different needs, and these differ between employees. •If employees are not motivated, managers seek to determine the needs of employees and which are satisfied or dissatisfied. The relationship between Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and employee engagement is shown as FIGURE 3-32. Figure 3-32 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs applied to employee engagement. Expectancy Theory. Expectancy theory is concerned with how people decide which behaviors to engage in and how much effort they give to that behavior. This theory focuses on the person’s perception of effort-to-performance and performance-to-outcome links. Essentially, a person asks, “If I work hard (effort), will I be able to perform?” Motivation is improved by strengthening that link. Managers want to be certain that employees believe that if they work hard, they will achieve high performance. Thus, providing training and education so that they have the appropriate skills to perform the work would improve motivation. In accordance with this theory, managers do the following: •Be certain employees possess the necessary skills to perform well. •Coach employees to believe that if they work hard they will","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_82"}}],["290",{"pageContent":"so that they have the appropriate skills to perform the work would improve motivation. In accordance with this theory, managers do the following: •Be certain employees possess the necessary skills to perform well. •Coach employees to believe that if they work hard they will be successful. •Know what outcomes employees perceive as important (as detailed by needs theory). •Establish clear policies about what levels of performance are rewarded (result in outcomes) and which levels are not. Individuals also ask themselves, “If I perform at a high level, will there be an outcome, and is it something I care about?” To strengthen this performance-outcome link, managers want employees to believe that if they perform at a high level, there is an outcome that they desire. Managers can strengthen this link by having valid performance appraisal systems to capture quality and safety performance. Systems should also be in place to reward such performance. For example, when an employee reports an adverse event, there should be an immediate outcome that is positive in the eyes of that employee. Equity Theory. Equity theory centers on the input and outcomes part of the motivation equation. The overall idea is that employees are motivated when there is fairness in the workplace. This theory contends that employees determine p. 184 p. 185 fairness by looking at the ratio of their inputs (work effort) to their outcomes (e.g., rewards, benefits). For example, Employee A may be motivated if he or she receives a financial bonus that he or she perceives to be equitable given his/her effort on the PI project. However, employees also compare the ratio of their inputs to outcomes with others’ inputs and outcomes. Therefore, if Employee B in the same department is awarded a larger financial bonus for the same amount of effort, Employee A’s motivation would probably drop. Some ways for managers to motivate employees include the following: •Acknowledge different performance levels with different levels of rewards. •Employ just culture principles and practices (see the section Patient Safety). •Periodically check employees’ perceptions about their own input and outcomes as well as those of others (through annual employee engagement surveys). •Know what outcomes are desirable and tie those to performance in a timely manner. Procedural Justice. Procedural justice is a theory of motivation that focuses on fairness with respect to processes or procedures used to allocate outcomes. Research demonstrates that people are more likely to see outcome allocations as fair when the following conditions exist: •Input from employees is sought and considered when decisions are made. •There","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_83"}}],["291",{"pageContent":"motivation that focuses on fairness with respect to processes or procedures used to allocate outcomes.

What Employees Say There is research support for these various motivation theories. In the past 25 years, the Gallup Organization undertook two extremely large studies. The first asked, “What do the most talented employees need from their workplace?” For this part of the research, Gallup interviewed more than 1 million people who were employed across a broad range of companies, industries, and countries. This study’s “most powerful” conclusion is that the retention and performance of an employee is determined “by his relationship with his immediate supervisor.”91 So, what makes a good supervisor? Gallup’s data indicate that there are 12 factors critical to the retention and performance of employees: •Do I know what is expected of me at work? •Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work correctly? •Do I have the opportunity at work to do what I do best every day? •In the last 7 days, did I receive recognition or praise for doing good work? •Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person? •Is there someone at work who encourages my development? •Do my opinions seem to count at work? •Does the mission or purpose of my work organization make me feel my job is important? •Are my coworkers committed to doing high-quality work? •Do I have a best friend at work? •In the last 6 months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress? •This past year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow? More recently, Harter and Adkins92 discussed the fact that employees want more from their managers. They found that 1.managers account for up to 70% of variance in engagement; 2.consistent communication is connected to higher engagement; and 3.managers must help employees develop their strengths. These factors clearly are consistent with the theories of motivation discussed previously.

These factors clearly are consistent with the theories of motivation discussed previously. Setting Up an Incentives and Reward System Given the role rewards play in employee motivation, setting up an effective reward system is important. Seven steps are fundamental to a reward system93: •Determine priorities and values; rewarded behaviors are prioritized. •Identify the criteria or milestones. •Establish a budget for recognition. •Determine who is accountable for managing the recognition. •Develop specific procedures and features of the rewards and recognition. •Obtain feedback from employees on desired rewards and recognition. •Modify program based on feedback. The most important step is to reward the desired behavior.94 Sharing Successes of Teams, Projects, and Initiatives Sharing organization success stories internally and externally is important for several reasons. As described earlier, it motivates employees and serves as both reward and recognition to them. The value is demonstrated to the employees in increasing knowledge transfer, learning from experience, sharing best p. 185 p. 186 practices, and stimulating innovation within the organization. Value is next demonstrated to the customer in showcasing successful processes and outcomes to the people served. Communicating successes also demonstrates accountability and transparency to the community and public served. There may be other stakeholders for whom communicating success is also important. Externally, sharing of lessons learned with other organizations, professional groups, online communities, and the public might be performed in different ways. Some of the more common groups for sharing are professional conferences, committees, and professional organizations. The report format often includes •abstract, •title, •objectives, •outline, •content, •results, and •references. In addition, sometimes the A3 format is used (FIG. 3-33) to address an improvement process. This format is usually standardized from Lean/Six Sigma projects. This usually includes the background; current condition; goal; analysis; proposal/recommendation/countermeasure; plan; follow-up.95 Figure 3-33 Example of A3 format. (From Shook, John Y.

One framework used to understand PI in complex systems is the Baldrige National Health Care Criteria for Performance Excellence Framework (https://www.nist.gov/baldrige). The Baldrige Award was created in 1987, named for former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige in tribute to his managerial ability. The award is given to organizations demonstrating a commitment to quality excellence. This model displays the principles of PI and shows the relationships between the structural, process, and outcome factors. Other common quality awards or designations are shown in TABLE 3-13.

Recognition of Internal Customers An important structural element in the quality, safety and PI program is recognizing internal customers. Every process has both internal and external customers. Most people readily understand the concept of being a supplier of goods to an external customer. However, the idea of internal customers is equally important. An employee can be a customer when they receive material, information, or services from others in the organization. Conversely, an employee also can be a supplier when they provide material, information, or services to others in the organization or to external customers. For example, when a nurse sends a specimen to the laboratory, the nurse is","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_88"}}],["296",{"pageContent":"from others in the organization. Conversely, an employee also can be a supplier when they provide material, information, or services to others in the organization or to external customers. For example, when a nurse sends a specimen to the laboratory, the nurse is the supplier and the laboratory is the customer. When the laboratory sends a report back to the nurse, the laboratory is the supplier and the nurse is the customer. Just as there are suppliers to p. 188 p. 189 internal customers, those internal customers can, in turn, be suppliers to external customers. This approach can help to •remind departments without direct contact with external customers that they are still a critical link to customer satisfaction; •improve relationships; •acknowledge the complexity of the work; •make the work process flow smoothly; and •avert potential bottlenecks. TABLE 3-15 provides an example of an approach one organization followed to ensure the recognition of internal customers.

Copyright 2000 by Jossey-Bass, with permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. In most healthcare organizations and as above, service excellence is as important as clinical excellence. For example, Sharp HealthCare, a Malcolm Baldrige award recipient, implemented several initiatives that formed the foundation of service excellence—what they refer to as The Sharp Experience.96 These include the following: 1.AIDET: Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, Thank you. 2.Behavior Standards: ⚬attitude is everything, ⚬reward and recognition, ⚬courteous communication, ⚬teamwork, ⚬service recovery, ⚬zero harm, ⚬performance matters, ⚬service excellence, ⚬privacy and confidentiality, ⚬electronic communication manners, ⚬mutual respect, and ⚬diversity. p. 189 p. 190 3.Must Haves ⚬Greet people with a smile and “Hello,” using their name when possible. ⚬Take people where they are going, rather than pointing or giving directions. ⚬Use key words at key times: “Is there anything else I can do for you?

The development and sharing of stories can be a potent means or promoting values and beliefs in an organization. StoryCorps, a nonprofit organization, helps organizations remind one another of our shared humanity, to strengthen and build the connections between people, to teach the value of listening, and to weave into the fabric of our culture the understanding that everyone’s story matters. At the same time, we are creating an invaluable archive for future generations.97(p2) The measurement of customer perception, satisfaction, engagement and loyalty is important for healthcare organizations to determine how their customers like the services provided. There are many vendors who survey these customers and provide data back to the organization for tracking, trending, and benchmarking performance. The CMS identified customer perception as a key component of measuring hospital performance and developed the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems98 (CAHPS) survey as a standardized method to compare performance and link payment to performance. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) is the first national, standardized, publicly reported survey of patients’ perspectives of hospital care. Before the advent of HCAHPS, there was no national standard for collecting and publicly reporting information about patient experience of care that allowed comparisons across hospitals locally, regionally, and nationally. The survey is designed to produce data about patients’ perceptions of care that allow objective comparisons of hospitals on topics that are important to consumers. Public reporting of the survey results increases accountability by increasing transparency in the quality of care. The CMS and the HCAHPS Project Team take steps to ensure the survey is credible, useful, and practical. In 2002, CMS partnered with the AHRQ to develop and test the HCAHPS survey. In May 2005, the HCAHPS survey was endorsed by the NQF, and approval for the national implementation for public reporting occurred in March 2008. The survey, methods, and results are in the public domain. p. 190 p. 191 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 created an additional incentive for acute care hospitals to participate in HCAHPS.

Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals that fail to publicly report the HCAHPS survey may receive an annual payment update that is reduced by 2 percentage points. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148) includes HCAHPS among the measures to be used to calculate value-based incentive payments in the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing program, with discharges since October 2012. HCAHPS results are published on the Hospital Compare website four times a year.99 The survey consists of both inpatient and outpatient items depending on the population assessed. Instruments are available for other settings such as for long-term care, but there are no comparative data collected or published for this setting and NCQA uses CAHPS version 5.0H survey as part of their HEDIS measures in evaluating health plan performance and accrediting plans. Organizational Learning and Training Everyone in the organization is responsible for quality and safety. Therefore, educating staff at all levels of the organization is critical to the success of quality and PI. Because the most common cause of failure in any performance or process improvement effort is uninvolved or indifferent top and middle management, it is essential that all leaders be educated from the start. Training begins at the top and cascades down through the organization. Ultimately, senior and middle management are part of the teaching team; this demonstrates to employees that they are committed to quality and safety. The method of education or training must be tailored to the audience and use tools and methods to match the audience needs and learning styles. Governing body or board members must also be included in understanding and their accountability for quality of care in the organization. Some form of board training is often included for new members. A comprehensive program for all levels of employees, management, board, and physicians is designed to meet the needs of these different groups. For example, board member training includes •a review of oversight responsibility for the organization’s quality and safety performance; •some form of quality, safety and PI committee or review function; •use of quality performance as a criterion in rating executive performance; and •trends and public reporting of the organization’s data and its image in the community","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_92"}}],["300",{"pageContent":"quality and safety performance; •some form of quality, safety and PI committee or review function; •use of quality performance as a criterion in rating executive performance; and •trends and public reporting of the organization’s data and its image in the community. Determining Education and Training Needs There are many ways to determine the educational needs of the healthcare workforce. Methods to obtain information include •evaluating knowledge and skills contained in the job description; •asking participants; •asking participants’ supervisors; •asking others who are knowledgeable about the job (e.g., customer, peers, experts in quality, safety and PI); •testing participants on their skills and knowledge; and •analyzing the participant’s past performance appraisals.93,100,101 Fundamentals of Performance Improvement Curriculum The PI curriculum includes the following elements: •Explanation of the need for organizational improvement, including individual and collective benefits of performance and process improvement; •Development and use of common quality language or taxonomy; •Discussion of the organization’s quality and safety goals; •Definition of the program structure; •Articulation of the organization’s philosophy and a model for improvement; •Description of the improvement process; •Description and clarification of responsibilities; •Tools and techniques to participate in teams and to manage work processes; •Description of how change may affect the individual’s job and work relationships; •Metrics and successful past projects in the organization; and •Reporting structure for leaders and staff. Tailor training to the specific needs of each group (i.e., top management, middle management, frontline staff). TABLE 3-16 offers a comparison of topics addressed across major groups in a quality, safety, and PI curriculum. There are some common reasons why managers are often reluctant to support training in quality, safety and PI. These barriers must be overcome for the organization to develop the infrastructure necessary to support healthcare quality and safety. Barriers include no results from the training, too costly, no involvement in the process, no time for staff to participate, and lack of preparation of programs.102(pp2–4) Table 3-16 Education and Training Topics Top Management Topics Middle Management Topics Staff Topics “What Everyone Should Know” •Quality as a strategic advantage •Role of leadership in creating and sustaining quality vision •Integrating quality values into day-to-day leadership •Indicators for measuring, evaluating and improving quality and organizational performance •Components of performance excellence and implementation process •Basic quality and performance improvement tools •Role as team leaders •Aware","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 3 - Performance and Process Improvement_93"}}],["301",{"pageContent":"and sustaining quality vision •Integrating quality values into day-to-day leadership •Indicators for measuring, evaluating and improving quality and organizational performance •Components of performance excellence and implementation process •Basic quality and performance improvement tools •Role as team leaders •Awareness of accreditation standards •Role as team champion •Key concepts of quality and performance management (e.g., customer satisfaction, process management, teamwork, continuous improvement methods) •Management practices for building teamwork, employee involvement and recognition for customer service •Team building and contributions for quality, team leadership skills, conflict resolution •Communication skills, listening and giving feedback •Principles of customer service •Managing process performance •(measurement, quality and performance improvement tools, variation, problem solving, data collection and analysis) •Measurement of quality outcomes •Accreditation/regulatory standards •Organization’s mission, vision, and performance improvement plan •Quality awareness, definition of quality •Fundamental training in quality and performance improvement, including process improvement tools and techniques •Concepts of quality management: customer satisfaction, process improvement, teamwork, continuous improvement •Promoting cooperation between coworkers within and between departments •Communication skills •Customer service •Relevant accreditation standards and regulatory requirements Another approach to considering training is the IHI Improvement Advisor Professional Development Program,71 which includes the following agenda for training: •science of improvement (includes high-reliability organizations), p. 191 p. 192 •model for improvement, •scoping improvement efforts, •understanding systems and processes, •using data for improvement, •understanding relationships, •gathering information, •organizing information, •developing powerful ideas for change, •testing changes, •implementing changes, •decision-making, •working with people, and •planned experimentation.

Requisite Skills to Lead Performance and Process Improvement Efforts The key operating assumption of capacity building is that different groups of people have different levels of need for knowledge and skills. A teaching plan ensures each group receives the knowledge and skill sets they need, when they need them, and in the appropriate amounts.

Section Summary A formal quality, safety, and PI program and infrastructure are required to ensure quality and safety. Models of PI, acquired from industry, have been adopted and applied to the healthcare setting. The tenets of quality and safety must first be developed through strategic planning. Strategic planning is supported by the establishment of priorities for performance and process improvement activities, translating strategic goals into quality outcomes, and aligning culture and structure. Various PI tools can be used within a team to make significant changes to core processes, and ultimately ensure good clinical outcomes by using evidence-based principles and practices. p. 193 p. 194 References 1.Gaucher EM, Coffey RJ.

Organizations are investing heavily in building the infrastructure to enhance capabilities to analyze and report valid and reliable quality, safety, and performance data. The impetus for change came from external and internal pressures (e.g., demonstrating value and delivering optimal care). This section describes the foundational steps to plan and deploy a data management system to support the quality improvement (QI) program, measure identification, measurement selection, sampling, balanced scorecards, dashboards, incorporating external data sources, identifying appropriate benchmarks, data collection, and data validation. Information is provided on the characteristics of data management systems, tools to display data, the application of statistical analysis, and how to interpret and compare data. How to interpret data is fundamental to the success of the organization. Finally, the principles presented throughout the section are applicable to reporting and setting goals to improve performance.

Historical Perspectives on Quality The need for quality has always existed. However, the means for meeting that need—the processes of managing and improving for quality—have undergone extensive and continuing change.1 Before the 20th century, managing quality was based on ancient principles that included product inspection by consumers, which is still widely used in today’s villages, and marketplaces concept, with which buyers rely on the skill and reputation of trained, experienced craftsmanship. As commerce expanded beyond village boundaries and with the growth of technology, additional methods and tools were invented to assist in managing for quality such as specifications by sample and quality warranties in sales contracts. In large towns, the craftsmen organized into monopolistic guilds, which generally were strict in their enforcement of product quality. Their strategies included mandated specifications for input materials, processes, and finished goods; audits of the performance of guild members; and export controls on finished goods. The early approach to managing for quality in the United States followed the prevailing practice in European countries that had colonized the North American continent. Apprentices learned a trade, qualified to become craftsmen, and in due course might become masters of their own shops. The Industrial Revolution, which originated in Europe, created the factory system. The factory out-produced the small independent shops and made them largely obsolete. The craftsmen became factory workers, and the masters became factory foremen. Quality was managed as before, through the skills of the craftsmen, and supplemented by departmental inspection or supervisory audits. When the Industrial Revolution spread to the United States, Americans again followed European practice. The Industrial Revolution also accelerated the growth of additional strategies, including written specifications for materials, processes, finished goods, and tests; measurement and the associated measuring instruments and testing laboratories; and standardization in many forms. p. 200 p. 201 During World War II, U.S. industry was faced with the added burden of producing enormous quantities of military products. A part of the war strategy was to shut down production of many civilian products such as automobiles, household appliances, and entertainment products.

A massive shortage of goods developed amid a huge buildup of purchasing power. It took the rest of that decade (the 1940s) for supply to catch up with demand. In the interim, manufacturing companies gave top priority to meeting delivery dates, so quality of products suffered. The practice of giving top priority to delivery dates persisted long after the shortages ended. A new strategy emerged during World War II—statistical quality control (SQC). To improve the quality of military goods, the War Production Board sponsored numerous training courses on the statistical techniques developed by the Bell System during the 1920s. W. E. Deming,2 who became widely known in quality improvement during the 1980s, was one of the lecturers at some of the War Production Board courses. Many training course attendees became enthusiastic and organized the American Society for Quality Control (now known as American Society for Quality [ASQ]). In its early years ASQ was strongly oriented toward SQC, thereby stimulating further enthusiasm for the method. After World War II, the Japanese embarked on a course of reaching national goals through trade rather than military means. The major manufacturers, which had been extensively involved in military production, were faced with converting to civilian products. A major obstacle to selling these products in international markets was a reputation for shoddy merchandise, created by the export of poor-quality goods before World War II. To solve their quality problems, the Japanese learned how other countries managed for quality, sending teams abroad to visit foreign companies and study their approaches. They also invited foreign lecturers to Japan to conduct training courses for managers. As the result of this educational process, the Japanese devised unprecedented strategies to create a revolution in quality. Several of those strategies proved crucial: •Upper managers personally took charge of leading the revolution. •All levels and functions underwent training in managing for quality. •QI was undertaken at a continuing, revolutionary pace. •Quality circle (QC) involved employee participation in decision-making and problem solving to improve the quality of work. During the early postwar period, American companies logically considered competition from the Japanese to be based on price rather than quality. Their response was to shift the manufacturing of labor-intensive products to low-labor-cost areas, often offshore. As time went on, price competition declined while quality competition increased.3 During the 1960s and 1970s","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_2"}}],["324",{"pageContent":"rather than quality.

As time went on, price competition declined while quality competition increased.3 During the 1960s and 1970s, numerous Japanese manufacturers greatly increased their share of the American market; a major reason was the superior quality of their products. Numerous industries were affected (e.g., consumer electronics, automobiles, steel, and machine tools). U.S. companies generally failed to notice the trend, continuing to believe that competition from the Japanese primarily was price-based rather than quality-based. Some observers sounded warning signals: “The Japanese are headed for world quality leadership and will attain it in the next two decades because no one else is moving there at the same pace.”4 The alarm was sounded at the conference of the European Organization for Quality Control in Stockholm in June 1966. The most obvious effect of the Japanese quality revolution was the massive export of goods. The impact on the United States was considerable, especially in sensitive areas such as manufacturing, steel, and electronics. The affected manufacturing companies were damaged by the resulting loss of sales. The workforce and their unions were damaged by the resulting “export of jobs.” The national economy was damaged by the resulting unfavorable trade balance. In healthcare, the major drivers for data analytics and information systems were Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s. Communication between departments and the need for discrete departmental systems were drivers in the 1970s. The 1980s drivers were diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and reimbursement. Integration due to mergers and consolidation was the major driver of analytics in the 1990s; and in the 2000s, a focus on value and outcomes-based reimbursement are major drivers for health data analytics and information systems.5 New Era of Data Analytics The use of data in healthcare delivery, monitoring, and improvement is rapidly evolving. Davenport6 championed the concept that if organizations were going to succeed, they needed to compete on analytics. This meant exploring Big Data with a recent emphasis on population health and value-based care. The strategy would use all the data captured by the organization’s disparate systems (e.g., medical records, human resources, finance, imaging) to support improvements in staffing, customer relationships, financial performance, services provided, product development and managing the supply chain.

Further, Davenport proposed that being successful would require an executive commitment to recognizing the importance of analytics capabilities, sophisticated information systems, and employing people with analytical skills. Big Data has three main characteristics and some added a fourth (veracity): 1.Volume: The physical size of the data and number of records are dramatically higher than what is typically managed on a traditional data system. p. 201 p. 202 2.Velocity: Data are received in near or real time or as a continuous stream and should be made available to inform decisions as quickly as possible (predictive, prescriptive analytics). 3.Variety: Data include structured records, unstructured text, images (medical imaging), audio, video, and biomedical sensor traces. 4.Veracity: The vast amounts of structured and unstructured data come from sources that may be uncertain or imprecise.7(p1),8 By 2013, McKinsey & Company reported that the Big Data revolution was substantially under way in healthcare.9 Several major health systems were using data to deliver better care, provide increased value, and innovate. Today almost every segment of the healthcare industry invests in Big Data. The scale of the investment varies depending on how much the organizations can afford to allocate to expand their analytic capabilities but they recognize that “competing on analytics” is necessary to survive in the current healthcare environment. This becomes particularly evident with the shift to population health and value-based care. With the proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) and health information exchanges (HIEs), large data sets are now available to healthcare professionals and health services researchers. The National Institutes of Health define biomedical Big Data as the “complexity, challenges and new opportunities presented by the combined analysis of data. In biomedical research, these data sources include the diverse, complex, disorganized, massive, and multimodal data being generated by researchers, hospitals, and mobile devices around the world.”10(1) Their Big Data to Knowledge or “BD2K” initiative acknowledges that there is a lack of appropriate tools, poor data accessibility, and insufficient training about Big Data in healthcare, which impedes rapid translation of data into useful information at the service level.11 The BD2K initiative has four aims to assist healthcare professionals in using Big Data: 1.Facilitate broad use of biomedical","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_4"}}],["326",{"pageContent":"training about Big Data in healthcare, which impedes rapid translation of data into useful information at the service level.11 The BD2K initiative has four aims to assist healthcare professionals in using Big Data: 1.Facilitate broad use of biomedical digital assets by making them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 2.Conduct research and develop the methods, software, and tools needed to analyze biomedical Big Data. 3.Enhance training in the development and use of methods and tools necessary for biomedical Big Data science. 4.Support a data ecosystem that accelerates discovery as part of a digital enterprise.11(3) By utilizing Big Data, infrastructure organizations can monitor populations (e.g., people with diabetes and asthma) to determine if the right care is being provided and assess health outcomes. Further, it is possible to drill down to specific providers and benchmark their performance. Hospitals that manage clinical bundles can use the data to evaluate the care delivered prior to discharge and to assess which post-acute providers deliver the best outcomes at the lowest cost. For example, a hospital could look at 30-, 60-, 90-day readmission rates for heart failure patients with care transitions to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), home healthcare, or home with no services. Choosing the organizations to partner with in the future might rely on performance. With a focus on data comes the need to accelerate the adoption of health IT. Technology is widely recognized and was singled out as a key goal by the Health Care Delivery and Information Technology (HCDIT) Subcommittee of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee.12 Studies suggest that the quality of healthcare can improve with the appropriate use of technology.13,14 These studies specifically highlight the need to facilitate the transmission of clinical information contained in the medical record between healthcare providers. A second goal identified by the HCDIT subcommittee is use of health IT to achieve substantial economic and social benefits (such as reducing medical errors, eliminating unproductive healthcare expenditures, and improving quality of care). As cited above, most hospitals adopted EHRs. In ambulatory care, only 54% had adopted a basic EHR and 78% of office-based physicians reported using an EHR.15 A lack of standards hindered the adoption of IT tools in the healthcare industry.13 The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) began to standardize formats and data for the electronic exchange of patient health record information","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_5"}}],["327",{"pageContent":"EHR.15 A lack of standards hindered the adoption of IT tools in the healthcare industry.13 The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) began to standardize formats and data for the electronic exchange of patient health record information in 2002,16 which progressed to the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) developing a set of principles to support IT interoperability in the United States.17 In addition, other organizations and task forces continue to work on international protocols and frameworks for data exchanges between heterogeneous systems in the healthcare industry. The industry Health Level 7 (HL7), the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), and Extensible Markup Language (XML) special interest groups were leaders in defining EHR standards. As these standards evolved, more comprehensive EHRs were developed and shared among all the providers in the healthcare system. EHRs sometimes are referred to as personal health records (PHRs). There is a distinction between the two types of records: PHRs are geared more toward consumers and EHRs pertain to records used and held by healthcare providers. Federal support increased since the 2004 announcement of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 10-year plan to create a new national health information infrastructure that will include an EHR for every American and a new network to link health records nationwide. Health IT and interoperable systems are requisites for healthcare delivery in the 21st century. Health IT potentially includes products such as EHRs, patient engagement tools such as PHRs and p. 202 p. 203 secure, private Internet portals, and HIEs. An IOM report18 that examined the state of the art in system safety and opportunities to build safer systems concluded as follows: •Safety is an emergent property of a larger system that considers not just the software but also how it is used by clinicians. •The “sociotechnical system” includes technology (software, hardware), people (clinicians, patients), processes (workflow), organization (capacity, decisions about how health IT is applied, incentives), and the external environment (regulations, public opinion). •Safer implementation and use of health IT is a complex, dynamic process that requires a shared responsibility between vendors and healthcare organizations. •Poor user-interface design, poor workflow, and complex data interfaces threaten patient safety. •Lack of system interoperability is a barrier to improving clinical decisions and patient safety. •","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_6"}}],["328",{"pageContent":", dynamic process that requires a shared responsibility between vendors and healthcare organizations. •Poor user-interface design, poor workflow, and complex data interfaces threaten patient safety. •Lack of system interoperability is a barrier to improving clinical decisions and patient safety. •Constant, ongoing commitment to safety—from acquisition to implementation and maintenance—is needed to achieve safer, more effective care.18(ppS2–S4) The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) was enacted under Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub.L. 111–5). Under the HITECH Act, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services authorized spending $25.9 billion to promote and expand the adoption of health IT. The HITECH Act also established meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the healthcare system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. Title IV of the Act included incentive payments ($63,750) for Medicaid providers who would adopt and use “certified EHRs” over 6 years beginning in 2011 Eligible professionals had to begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare, the maximum payments were set at $44,000 over 5 years. To receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH Act required providers to show “meaningful use” of an EHR system. Meaningful use is defined as using certified EHR technology to •improve quality, safety, and efficiency; reduce health disparities; •engage patients and family; •improve care coordination, and population and public health; and •maintain privacy and security of patient health information.19 Meaningful use compliance results include better clinical outcomes, improved population health outcomes, increased transparency and efficiency, empowered consumers, and more robust research data on health systems. Meaningful use sets specific objectives that eligible professionals and hospitals must achieve to qualify for the financial incentive programs. These objectives are defined as the “Stages of Meaningful Use.” •Stage 1 (2011 to 2012)—Data capture and sharing; •Stage 2 (2014)—Advance clinical processes; •Stage 3 (2016)—Improved outcomes.

The impact of the federal initiatives that supplied the stimulus funding and the requirements for meaningful use benefit the use of data for quality, safety, and performance improvement efforts. Certified EHRs can potentially be a rich source of standardized and structure information that can be used by quality, safety, and performance improvement teams to measure the impact of improvement activities and assess patient clinical outcomes. Data and Information Healthcare professionals are constantly challenged to sift and interpret the vast amount of data available and then distinguish what is relevant, meaningful, and important to plan a course of action. Nutley and Reynolds20 described eight activities to encourage and improve the use of health data to strengthen health systems. These include the following: 1.Assess and improve the data use context. Organizational and behavioral factors influence whether an organization uses data to inform decision-making; whether it promotes a culture of information. 2.Engage data users and data producers. Lack of communication is a barrier in those who produce data and those who need data to make decisions. 3.Improve data quality. For managers to make sound decisions for improving processes, they need to be confident that the data they are relying on is sound—accurate, complete, and timely. 4.Improve data availability. This includes data synthesis, data communication, and access to data. Management information systems (MISs) can facilitate data being available to decision-makers. 5.Identify information needs. Various stakeholders have various data and information needs, and their audiences may be different. Healthcare quality professionals can help managers prioritize those data that will be useful in monitoring and evaluating a program or service. 6.Build capacity in the data use core competencies. Frontline staff and managers need to be competent in data analysis, interpretation, synthesis, and presentation, and how to develop data-informed recommendations. 7.Strengthen the organization’s data demand and use infrastructure. Data-informed decision-making requires that the culture supports the use of data, that an infrastructure exists to ensure data quality, and processes are in place to obtain and report data-rich outcomes. p. 203 p. 204 8.Monitor, evaluate, and communicate results of data use interventions.

There is a distinction between data and information. •Data are the representation of things, facts, concepts, and instructions that are stored in a defined format and structure on a passive medium (e.g., paper, computer, microfilm). For leadership to be confident that the data they are using to make decisions are sound, there must be an emphasis on data quality. The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) defined 10 characteristics of data quality (see TABLE 4-1). The top four characteristics are accuracy, accessibility, comprehensiveness, and consistency. Table 4-1 Data Quality Characteristics Characteristic Meaning Accuracy Data represent correct values, valid, and attached to the correct patient record. Accessibility Data items are easily obtained and legal to access with strong protections and controls built into the process. Comprehensiveness All required data items are included; entire scope of the data is collected and documents intentional limitations. Consistency Value of the data is reliable and the same across applications. Currency Data are up-to-date. Definition Clear definitions provided so that current and future data users will know what the data mean. Each data element has clear meaning and acceptable values. Granularity Attributes and values of data are defined with the correct level of detail. Precision Data values are just large enough to support the application or process.

The Quality Measurement and Management Project developed the following seven basic concepts related to quality-management information: 1.Healthcare data must be carefully defined and systematically collected and analyzed in their full context before they can be useful in quality-management. 2.Tremendous amounts of healthcare data and information are available, but not all of it is useful for quality management. 3.Mature information revolves around clearly established patterns of care, not individual cases. Patterns identify a consistent process that can be studied and improved. 4.Most quality indicators currently available are useful only as indicators of potential problems and not as definitive measures of quality. 5.Multiple measures of quality need to be integrated to provide a clear picture of quality of care in an institution or managed care organization. 6.Developing outcomes information without monitoring the process of care, when warranted, is inefficient because it cannot lead directly to improvement in quality. 7.Cost and quality are inse","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_10"}}],["332",{"pageContent":"picture of quality of care in an institution or managed care organization. 6.Developing outcomes information without monitoring the process of care, when warranted, is inefficient because it cannot lead directly to improvement in quality. 7.Cost and quality are inseparable issues.23(28) Bader and Bohr23 translated the seven concepts to a ­seven-step strategy for the interpretation and use of quality-of-care information, which are still relevant today. These steps are outlined below. Step 1. Planning and Organizing for Data Collection, Interpretation, and Use. Planning for collection and utilization of internally and externally generated data leads to a higher likelihood of success. Anticipating barriers, identifying responsibilities, and laying the groundwork for multidisciplinary p. 204 p. 205 and inter-professional collaboration can more smoothly guide the process toward improvement. Consideration needs to be given to whether the data will be quantitative (e.g., clinical values) or qualitative (e.g., a review of clinical notes). Qualitative data require a rigorous process that delineates exactly where to look for the data and what needs to be captured. In addition, a data dictionary that defines all data elements and calculations of indicators can be an invaluable element to improve the communication of information. Step 2. Verifying and Correcting Data. The purpose of verifying data is to identify data limitations and opportunities to improve internal systems that lead to better data quality, provide an opportunity to correct data (e.g., find missing data), and to review data to become familiar with it. For qualitative data, it is necessary to establish interrater reliability to ensure staff who reviewed clinical records consistently captured the same information. Step 3. Identifying and Presenting Potentially Important Findings. The first step in this process is to perform preliminary data analysis, often descriptive analyses. When conducting this type of analysis, it is recommended that several questions be addressed. •How do these data compare with other organizations’ (as with mortality rates) or with previously trended internal data (for example, healthcare-associated infection rates)? •What is the trend over time? Is it static, improving, or worsening? •How are data likely to be interpreted (or misinterpreted)? •Is there an opportunity for improvement? •Who receives the data? For what purpose? Data must be translated into meaningful information. Several techniques are used to present information in a clear and concise manner. Step 4.

For what purpose? Data must be translated into meaningful information. Several techniques are used to present information in a clear and concise manner. Step 4. Continuing to Study and Develop Recommendations for Change. If further study of the data is warranted, a variety of methods are available. These include variation analysis, review of additional data, retrospective medical reviews, and process analysis. Variation analysis seeks an explanation for statistically significant differences in the data. These differences may reflect clinical factors, patient characteristics, data collection (such as sampling characteristics), or organizational characteristics (such as staffing). Additional data may need to be collected and reviewed to completely understand variations in data. For example, a hospital may show a steady increase in mortality rates. Additional data related to hospital case mix, diagnostic categories, mortality within a specified time from date of hospital admission, and other hospital characteristics may be used to fully interpret the data. Focused/intensive retrospective review refers to an activity for which processes or outcomes use pre-established criteria or indicators. Findings may be presented in peer review or other settings. Process analysis refers to a method of analyzing data using industrial performance improvement techniques. Process analysis occurs when a group diagrams p. 205 p. 206 a healthcare process. The group then measures process variations and looks for ways to improve the process and the administrative or clinical outcome. Step 5. Taking Action. “Taking action” implies that people, teams, departments, and committees are empowered to make decisions and implement changes based on information discovered through data analysis. Actions may occur in several forms: education and training of staff, simulation, education and reporting of findings to outside vendors or the public, changes in organizational or departmental policies and processes, and changes in practice patterns. Step 6. Monitoring Performance. Monitoring performance entails monitoring the influence and effectiveness of a quality, safety, or performance improvement action and involves the collection of additional data. Questions to be considered include the following: •Have the proposed changes been implemented? To what extent? •How could compliance with the changes be enhanced? •What effect are the changes having on patient outcomes? Are these desirable effects? •Are changes modified and then tested further, communicated on a wider scale, tested for a longer period before drawing conclusions, or ended because they are ineffective? Step 7. Communicating Results.

Step 7. Communicating Results. There are three basic barriers to the interpretation and use of information: human factors, statistical factors, and organizational factors. 1.Human factors include fear of the data; resentment of external data; unrealistic expectations about data (including the myth that all data must be perfect); and lack of training related to planning, organizing, and analyzing data. 2.Statistical factors include flawed data, missing data, untimely data, poorly displayed data, and data that are difficult to integrate with other organizational data. 3.Organizational factors include data overload; a poor data retrieval system; lack of resources (time, people, money); and poor relationships among administration, physicians, and staff. Communication is an integral component in each of the previous steps. Striving for healthcare quality is a journey. Performance improvement begins with the communication of where an organization is and where it is going. Effective communication requires providing information to the appropriate staff so they can act. Consider which audiences and methods of communication will be most effective in bringing about change. Depending on the findings, audiences may include frontline clinical staff for patient issues, administration for service delivery failures, or the human resources department for staffing concerns. Design and Management Quality, safety, and performance improvement activities and research exist on a continuum of rigor and may be viewed more like a soft science (TABLE 4-3). The scientific approach is the most sophisticated method of acquiring knowledge and involves inductive and deductive reasoning, which might p. 206 p. 207 be considered superior to those arrived at through reliance on tradition, authority, and experience. The underlying assumptions of design, measurement, and interpretation are similar. Research utilization is a key aspect of the QI process and critical to achieving healthcare quality as defined by the local, state, and federal regulations and standards. Healthcare quality professionals use the level of research rigor that best answers the specific performance improvement question and area of study balancing rigor and practicality. Research studies and systematic reviews can be evaluated for usefulness to a practice setting using critical appraisal tools. These tools guide healthcare quality professionals through the research critique process, allowing effective evaluation and synthesis of research findings for use in performance improvement activities.24 When the healthcare quality professional begins the design process for activities, the goodness of project fit (QI process versus research process) by examining the question to be answered, data collection, analysis plan","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_13"}}],["335",{"pageContent":"synthesis of research findings for use in performance improvement activities.24 When the healthcare quality professional begins the design process for activities, the goodness of project fit (QI process versus research process) by examining the question to be answered, data collection, analysis plan, and application of findings.

Quality Measurement Performance outcomes measurement or decision support systems can provide a primary focus to determine the quality of healthcare services provided to consumers. By analyzing data and information generated by an effective performance outcomes measurement system, healthcare quality professionals will be able to help identify areas in which to improve quality and resources in their organizations. Other uses for outcomes systems include helping to identify how an organization measures up in relation to its competitors, identifying individual providers and practitioners who meet acceptable levels of quality, allowing providers to respond more rapidly to market changes, paying for exceptional performance, and justifying value-based services. Chassin et al.25 suggested that quality, safety, and performance improvement programs can focus explicitly on maximizing health benefits to patients and, to achieve the goal, measures must be included that advance knowledge about whether the goal is being achieved. They note four criteria for accountability measures (i.e., process measures; if met, there will be a higher likelihood of improving patient outcomes). The criteria include the following: •Strong evidence base shows that the care process leads to improved outcomes. •Measure accurately captures the provision of evidence-based care. •Measure addresses a process with few intervening steps that must occur before the improved","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_14"}}],["336",{"pageContent":"improving patient outcomes).

Healthcare quality professionals facilitate analysis and interpretation of outcomes data for an organization. The reference point for the outcomes data are always kept in mind whenever the results of such data are analyzed. The overall goals for use of outcomes and decision-support data are to improve quality, reduce costs and resource consumption, increase organizational profitability, and develop an information-based strategic plan. Comparisons of length of stay (LOS), costs, complications, and mortality cannot be made legitimately without adjusting severity at the patient level. Severity adjustment and clinical case mix permit effective analysis and eliminate practitioners’ concerns that “their patients are sicker.” Evidence to support the focus of measurement is shown as TABLE 4-5. Table 4-5 Evidence to Support the Focus of Measurement Measure Type Evidence Example of Measure Type and Evidence Health Outcome An outcome of care is the health status of a patient (or change in health status) resulting from healthcare, desirable or adverse. In some situations, resource use may be considered a proxy for a health state (e.g., hospitalization may represent deterioration in health status).

Risk Adjustment Risk adjustment is a technique used to consider or to control the fact that different patients with the same diagnosis may have additional conditions or characteristics that can affect how well they respond to treatment. Analysis of outcomes data p. 207 p. 208 p. 208 p. 209 using statistical techniques considers and controls for patient characteristics or conditions that are clinically meaningful and demonstrates a statistical effect on the rates for each condition. This removes the bias effect that can result when practitioners primarily treat patients who are more likely to experience desirable outcomes, such as those with fewer risk factors or co-occurring illnesses (morbidities). Some outcomes measurement systems define the differences between risk adjustment and severity, whereas other systems use the terms interchangeably. However, there is a difference. Patients in a study population may respond with either “yes” or “no” when asked if they have had certain outcomes; the outcomes variable in this case is binary. The probability of a “yes” answer is the risk of the outcome. Statistical methodologies to adjust for risk are applied to the outcomes data to predict patient-specific variables such as certain diagnoses that are risk factors.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_17"}}],["339",{"pageContent":"the outcomes variable in this case is binary. The probability of a “yes” answer is the risk of the outcome. Statistical methodologies to adjust for risk are applied to the outcomes data to predict patient-specific variables such as certain diagnoses that are risk factors. The validity of each risk adjustment model is assessed based on the choice of risk factors, including both potential risk factors and those included in the model, and through measures of how well the predictions match overall experience. This assessment includes indicators such as measures of patient subpopulations, including patients with more than one risk factor, and the concordance statistic, which shows, in percentages, how accurate the model is at predicting the outcome. The yes-or-no nature of outcomes data means that outcomes can refer to clinical outcomes, such as inpatient C-section complication rates. Outcomes also can be defined by using LOS and charges or cost, such as when an LOS exceeds a certain number of days and results in a “yes” or “no” answer. When the categories are in two or more groups, a set of outcomes can be defined and the risk adjustment methodologies can be applied to the full set of outcomes at the same time. An important distinction must be made between the statistical analysis of binary and continuous data. Risk adjustment methodologies do not apply to dependent variables that are continuous, like cost or LOS. The answer could be any number on a continuum, not “yes” or “no.” Severity adjustment methodologies are applied to the cost of LOS data to predict severity by using patient-specific variables, called severity factors. Frequently, the presence of additional diagnoses helps to define the severity of a group of patients within a DRG, on an individual patient level, or both. Both risk-adjusted and severity-adjusted data are extremely important outcomes system tools. Using unadjusted or raw data means that all patients in the clinical topic category, regardless of their health status or the existence of varying clinical conditions, are included in the rate calculation. Both raw and risk-adjusted data can be made available on the same outcomes topic because payers frequently use risk-adjusted data in their initial decision-making. Healthcare quality professionals also must be familiar with the ways in which their decision-support databases handle statistical “outliers.” Are all patients included, or are patients more than two standard deviations (SDs) from the mean removed from data analysis?

Most decision-support databases have a consistent approach regarding patients who are outliers. It is critical during data comparisons to make p. 209 p. 210 sure that all data sources managed patient outliers in a consistent fashion. For example, a hospital physician group was trying to compare its performance on resource utilization and LOS for community-acquired pneumonia. One patient was hospitalized for more than 100 days because the patient was ventilator-dependent and did not have adequate resources to be placed in an extended care facility. This patient’s record needed to be removed from the raw data before a fair comparison could be made. Another factor to consider in the analysis and interpretation of outcomes data is the level of detail. The best system includes clinical and financial information for every payer and practitioner and the patient. This integrated data repository can mine data for •benchmarking quality performance against established standards; •comparing physician performance within given outcome topics; •examining details at the patient level; •viewing patient diagnoses, procedures, and other information; •determining the impact of managed care on costs and outcomes; and •analyzing product lines to evaluate their effectiveness and to increase or downsize service offerings. Evidence-Based Practice Evidence-based medicine is the “conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”26(71) Because multiple disciplines are involved in healthcare delivery, however, the term evidence-based practice (EBP) is more appropriate than evidence-based medicine from a healthcare quality perspective. Clinicians base their care not only on experimental evidence but also consider experiential evidence, physiologic principles, patient and professional values, and system features in their decision-making. This practice allows individualized application and diffusion of aggregate research evidence.27,28 There are many benefits to using EBP including the following: •Promotes quality and patient safety through the provision of effective and efficient healthcare resulting in less variation in care and fewer unnecessary or nontherapeutic interventions.29 •Iterative with outcomes measurement; one facilitates the other.30 •Complements the principles of continuous quality, safety, and performance improvement.

This type of research helps ­healthcare quality professionals determine clinical evidence-based best practices. Health services research evaluates the health system at the micro and macro levels. Results from this type of research guide ­healthcare quality professionals in improving work processes and systems of care. Epidemiological Principles The influence of quality, safety, and performance improvement can be enhanced through the application of clinical epidemiology (e.g., case-control studies, cohort studies, propensity score matching) to data collected on many patients for relatively little cost. This comports to a recent emphasis in the healthcare industry related to “population health.” Comprehensive linked databases have enormous potential to provide information on the influence of tests and treatments on health. The potential value of these data can be realized if (1) actual receipt of these interventions, health outcomes, and potentially confounding variables can be ascertained accurately for individual patients; and (2) selection bias can be minimized by identifying an appropriate basis for comparison.31 For example, it is possible to assess changes in patient outcomes after an “improvement intervention” on a specific nursing unit by comparing those outcomes to a matched group of patients from other units in a hospital or over a prior period for the same unit when adjusting for any confounding variables. Using data available in electronic records and appropriate statistical methods makes it possible to test for statistical differences related to a quality, safety, or process improvement initiative compared to current practice. This level of analysis generally makes the results more robust, leading to wider acceptance across an organization and broad adoption of the improvement effort (also known as “spread”). Population Health Healthcare is moving beyond the episode of care to determine health outcomes. Population health is defined as “the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.”32(380) It considers all the determinants of health, including medical care, social and physical environments and related services, genetics, and individual behavior. An inherent byproduct of population health is the identification, reduction, or elimination of inequity and health disparities.33 With healthcare reform emerged population health management, which requires many different types of data to guide population care delivery p. 210 p.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_20"}}],["342",{"pageContent":"inherent byproduct of population health is the identification, reduction, or elimination of inequity and health disparities.33 With healthcare reform emerged population health management, which requires many different types of data to guide population care delivery p. 210 p. 211 and to understand the value of these programs. Population health management (or population medicine) “is the design, delivery, coordination, and payment of high-quality healthcare services to manage the Triple Aim for a population using the best resources available within the healthcare system.”33(¶11) Population health is another area where data are large volume and high velocity. When the data are available, organizations can assess how they are managing high-risk and high-volume patients, as well as the general population. For example, it is often helpful to know what percentage of the population are high utilizers in terms of hospitalizations or emergency room visits and to determine the characteristics of these patients so they can be better managed (e.g., more visits to their primary care provider, better diet, behavioral health referrals). In another example, Boult and Wieland found that these four features contributed to better population management of primary care for older adults with chronic illnesses: 1.comprehensive assessment of the patient’s health conditions, treatments, behaviors, risks, supports, resources, values, and preferences; 2.evidence-based care planning and monitoring to meet the patient’s health-related needs and preferences; 3.promotion of patients’ and family caregiver’s active engagement in care; and 4.coordination and communication among all the professionals engaged in a patient’s care, especially during transitions from the hospital.34 These population management activities are amenable to measurement and analytics. As payment shifts toward value versus volume, it is more prevalent for organizations to be evaluated based on how they are managing entire populations. Payers are putting providers at-risk to achieve the best outcomes for these groups of patients. Without good data and analytics, it is almost impossible to achieve the goal of being a high-performing organization in meeting the needs of specific populations. Information Systems Information systems can be used to support a variety of activities within healthcare organizations.

An organization needs to select the best health information system and technology that supports quality, safety, and performance improvement practices such as •measurement, •tracking, •sharing healthcare delivery performance measures, •monitoring refinements to clinical workflow processes (both internal and external), •effects of change on overall patient experience and care coordination across care settings, and •reducing costs and improve patient health outcomes.36(pp4–5) An organization can use a checklist to evaluate various system options. Rarely do organizations build their own information management systems. If an organization chooses to buy or build its own, there are considerations when looking at functionality, developing the architecture, and implementing and maintaining the system.

Administrative Support Information Systems Administrative support information systems aid day-to-day operations in healthcare organizations, including •financial information systems (payroll, accounts payable, patient accounting cost accounting, forecasting, budgeting and asset management); •human resources information systems (employee record, time and attendance, position and performance management, labor analysis, turnover, and absenteeism); and •office automation systems (word processing, e-mail, scheduling, facsimile/scanning, and spreadsheets","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_23"}}],["345",{"pageContent":"•human resources information systems (employee record, time and attendance, position and performance management, labor analysis, turnover, and absenteeism); and •office automation systems (word processing, e-mail, scheduling, facsimile/scanning, and spreadsheets). Management Information Systems A MIS can contain both the manual and the automated methods that provide information for decision-making. Other names for an MIS, which are used interchangeably, include data-processing structure, medical information system, hospital information system, or decision support system. The term, as it commonly is used, refers to an automated or computerized system. Information plays a key role in decision-making in each stage of the management process. p. 211 p. 212 p. 212 p. 213 Whether a staff member or manager is trying to establish goals, estimate resources, allocate resources, evaluate a quality, safety or performance process, or monitor a system, access to accurate and timely information is an ongoing requirement of any MIS. The quality of judgments and decisions directly correlates with availability and reliability of data and its synthesis into meaningful, timely information. Choices for the design or flow of information are so important that they can be a determining factor in the survival of a patient or organization. Although accurate and timely healthcare information provides the rationale for management decisions, this often is not the case. O’Rourke and Bader37 explain that information often is incomplete, confusing, and not sufficiently relevant to the organization’s mission, strategic goals, or customer and stakeholder needs when it is presented in many governing body reports. Organizations clarify the difference between data and information. And, data must be carefully selected, validated, and formatted to make reports useful. This often is easier to mandate than accomplish. However, the goal remains that governing body reports contain only the critical information needed for effective decision-making. Achieving this goal would eliminate healthcare data being presented as a pile of computer printouts and various fragmented reports. Clinical Information Systems Designed to support direct patient care processes, automated clinical information systems have great potential for analyzing and improving the quality of patient care. Barriers to healthcare leaders’ and healthcare organizations’ implementation of MIS include normal resistance to change, the mindset that patient care is best managed by people, lack of exposure to the application of information science and computers in healthcare educational and training programs, and inadequate resources.

In 2008, only 9.4% of non-federal acute care hospitals had a basic EHR system; in 2014, that percentage rose to 75.5%, due in large part to the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009.38 Nearly all reported hospitals had a certified EHR, one that met the technological capability, functionality, and security requirements adopted by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).38(1) From a managed care perspective, Rontal39 outlined the following criteria as being needed for an MIS: appropriate use, place of service, specific procedures, preventive care, cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, chronic illness management, access to care, and patient education. Also needed are outcomes of care for mortality, morbidity, complications, readmissions, quality of life, and disability. Clinical information systems often depend on integration with administrative information systems for some data. Currently, expanded clinical information systems include EHRs and their retrieval systems, computer-assisted medical decision-making for history and physicals and antibiotic selection, clinical application programs for health-risk programs, health maintenance organization encounter data, clinical algorithms, predictive modeling, and simulation. To analyze and interpret outcomes data, EHR-based systems allow healthcare providers to identify positive and negative outcomes so that appropriate action can be taken. Both types of systems serve to focus users on areas of concern regarding outcomes performance. Cost savings occur because energy can be focused on analyzing and controlling deviations from the baseline. Decision Support Systems Decision-support data facilitate cross-functional analyses to improve patient care processes and outcomes. Decision support systems address strategic planning functions. Included in this area are •strategic planning and marketing, •resource allocation, •performance evaluation and monitoring, •product evaluation and services, and •medical management (e.g., EBP, clinical guidelines and pathways). By integrating financial and clinical data, there is an opportunity to perform highly sophisticated data analysis involving predictive outcome management. These data help healthcare quality managers and executive leadership evaluate current operations and the feasibility of the development of new product lines and services. Healthcare quality managers coordinate outcome and decision-support data by posing the following pertinent questions: •What kinds of comparative analyses will be most important? •With whom can we compare ourselves? •How can we be sure the data are comparable?","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_25"}}],["347",{"pageContent":"lines and services.

Organizations use decision support systems to develop an outcomes information management plan, which includes evaluating performance outcomes measurement systems. Outcomes are viewed in terms of various clinical topics including mortality, complication rates, infection rates, Cesarean section (C-section) rates, fall rates, and other clinical outcomes measurement categories. Categories may or may not reflect the resources (cost, charges, LOS), associated with a given outcome. Bright and colleagues40 assessed healthcare process measures and clinical outcome measures associated with p. 213 p. 214 commercially and locally developed clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). This study found that a CDSS is effective in improving healthcare process measures across diverse settings. “Effect of Clinical Decision-Support Systems: A Systematic Review” explained the benefits of CDSS and suggested more research is required to promote the use of CDSS and to increase the clinical effectiveness of the systems. However, evidence is limited about the impact on certain outcome measures (i.e., economic and financial). This research expands on the 2012 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence report “Enabling Health Care Decisionmaking Through Clinical Decision Support and Knowledge Management,” which discussed key features for successful CDSS implementation. Registries Registries are part of the bigger picture of health date integration to generate new ideas and drive innovations in individual and population health management. A disease registry is an information tool for tracking the clinical care and outcomes of a defined population. Most disease registries support care management for groups of patients with one or more chronic diseases, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, or asthma. Data registries include information about the health status of patients and the healthcare they receive over varying periods of time. Data registries typically focus on patients who share a common reason for receiving healthcare (e.g., specific procedure performed or primary diagnosis). Registries allow healthcare professionals and others to see how patients with different characteristics respond to various treatments. The information is often used to inform patients and their providers about the best course of treatment for a patient. Information from registries is often utilized to compare the performance of healthcare providers regarding their outcomes","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_26"}}],["348",{"pageContent":"to see how patients with different characteristics respond to various treatments.

Information from registries is often utilized to compare the performance of healthcare providers regarding their outcomes. Registries are another tool to evaluate the care being delivered and identify opportunities for improvement. The challenge with registries is that some are designed for submission of the information to a national or state database and may have very limited local reporting capabilities. Patient Data Healthcare facilities and clinical staff who treat patients are required to maintain adequate medical/health records to serve as a basis for planning care and for communicating about patients’ conditions and treatments with other healthcare providers. The medical or health record serves other purposes as well. For example, medical records are reviewed by administrative staff performing quality, utilization, and risk management (RM) functions and by physicians engaged in peer review. Outside organizations also use the medical record for matters relating to payment and accreditation. In malpractice cases, the medical record serves as the major source of evidence about the care the patient received. Information contained in medical records also is used in retrospective clinical research. If protected health information (PHI) is collected for research, institutional review board approval is needed. Healthcare organizations have a clear policy about who can access medical records, whether those records are written, computerized, or otherwise maintained. Policy statements make clear what, other than actual medical records, constitutes a portion of the record. For example, with the advent of and frequent use of photography, videotaping of procedures or fetal heart monitoring strips, it is important to address (based on state law and legal advice) whether such media are part of the medical record. Information is often exchanged for the purposes of health treatment and payment. Organizations are required by federal and state statutes to maintain the security, integrity, and confidentiality of patients’ personal data and other information. An organizational plan for health information management (HIM) addresses the critical balance between data sharing and data confidentiality. Although timely, easy access to data and information is required, organizations also must ensure that data and information are safeguarded. The organization is responsible for protecting records against loss, defacement, tampering, and unauthorized use. Each organization must determine the level of security, integrity, and confidentiality for different categories of information. Access to each category of information must have a functioning mechanism designed to preserve the confidentiality of data and information identified as sensitive or requiring extraordinary means to protect patient privacy.

Organizations must follow the standards developed by their accreditation organization (e.g., CARF International [CARF], The Joint Commission, National Committee for Quality Assurance [NCQA], URAC, Community Health Accreditation Partner [CHAP]). Training programs must be in place to educate staff about these requirements and consequences of not adhering to institutional policies. The organization also must identify sanctions for employees who breach confidentiality. Healthcare organizations must keep confidential all PHI pertaining to medical peer review, quality, safety, and performance improvement, and the monitoring and evaluation of patient care. PHI is defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. All records that can be identified by patient or provider are kept secure and confidential so that the patient’s and provider’s privacy can be maintained. This includes the medical record (in any format, hard copy or electronic) and may also include reports, data abstracts, and supplies. Effective information management security and confidentiality policies and procedures in a healthcare organization contain the following elements: •identification of people with access to information; •delineation of specific information to which people have access; p. 214 p. 215 •requirements for people with access to information to keep that information confidential; •HIPAA requirements for release of health information; •requirements for removal of medical records (a patient’s medical record is the property of the healthcare facility); medical records are removed from the organization jurisdiction and into safekeeping only in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or statute; •protection of PHI41; •handling the root cause analysis (RCA) reporting requirement if the organization is Joint Commission-accredited; and •mechanisms for securing information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and damage.

This is one of several relationships recognized as special by law. The preservation of confidentiality is viewed as essential to the maintenance of the relationship. The need for confidentiality in the physician–patient relationship gives rise to a legal privilege. This means that, absent a patient authorization or waiver or an overriding law or public policy, medical information about a patient is protected from the process known as discovery, through which parties to a lawsuit normally can compel disclosure of relevant evidence. In certain states, the physician–patient privilege is extended beyond physicians to protect the patient’s relationship with other healthcare practitioners (e.g., psychologists, clinical social workers, clinical nurse specialists, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, and nurse practitioners). Information that is privileged must satisfy the following conditions: •It must have been communicated in the context of the physician–patient relationship. •It must have been given with the expectation that it remains confidential. •It must be necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient. In understanding the function of the medical record to provide information about the patient’s care, treatment, and services and to serve as the method of sharing this information between caregivers, there are monitoring processes to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the record and reflect the pertinent clinical documentation. The medical record may be a hard copy document or electronic (or a combination). With legislation demanding that healthcare organizations implement EHRs, the use of electronic records increased. A written consent is required for an organization to release patient information to anyone outside the organization. A typical release of information form contains the following elements: •patient name; •name of individual/organization requesting information; •reason for release of information; •anticipated use of information released; •exact material to be released, including reference to PHI; •period during which the release of information is valid; •documentation that information is released only to the individual/organization named above; and •signature and date of the patient or legal representative (as defined by policy/state law).

These people may include the •representatives from the governing body; •organization director (chief executive); •healthcare personnel involved in the care of a patient; •people responsible for quality, safety, and performance improvement activities; and •people in the HIM/medical records department. HIPAA requires healthcare providers (e.g., doctors and health plans) to obtain written authorization from patients to share medical record information. This may be for purposes unrelated to treatment, payment, or routine healthcare operations. The authorization form can originate from the hospital, physician, or health plan, or it can come from the organization requesting the data, such as a researcher, employer, or insurance company. There is no mandated form but a valid form must include several core elements such as the name, purpose of disclosure, and expiration date. Mechanisms are established to inform patients of utilization management policies and procedures. A common method to inform and obtain consent is to include a statement on the admission consent form or consent for treatment form. Of concern is provision of the reason for hospitalization, such as treatment of substance use disorders, treatment of mental health disorders, HIV/AIDS, and other PHI as identified by HIPAA or special considerations (e.g., Substance Abuse Confidentiality Regulations, 42 CFR Part 2 Revised). These policies must be communicated to the third-party payer as part of the contract review process. Medical Peer Review Policies and procedures ensure confidentiality during the medical peer review process. They are consistent with organizational policies and procedures (usually within the HIM/medical records department) and may include completion of a confidentiality statement signed by staff and practitioners involved in the peer review process. The nature of the data contained in a medical record is highly confidential. Policies and procedures clearly define who may have access to a medical record and under what circumstances in accordance with medical staff bylaws, hospital policy, and applicable laws and regulations. Because of the complexity of those issues, consultation from general counsel regarding national and state statutes is critical. Practitioner profiles can be maintained as a part of the credentials file or in a separate locked file. Most states have laws governing medical peer review and its activities. When applicable, files and their contents and meeting minutes are marked as “Confidential—peer review according to statute X.” A simple “CONFIDENTIAL” stamp also will suffice.

This mechanism is in place in response to the need to evaluate a practitioner’s competence for appointment and reappointment to other healthcare institutions. Committee minutes of quality, safety, and performance improvement activities usually are protected under medical peer review statutes. Consequently, maintaining confidentiality of records extends beyond credentialing to the entire quality, safety, and performance improvement program within an organization.

The initiatives selected usually focus on core processes, high-risk processes, high-risk patients and populations, high-risk medications, or high-risk actions/interventions. The level of risk is based on the potential consequences of injury or harm to patients. Managing high-risk patients and processes p. 216 p. 217 will significantly affect morbidity and mortality. Examples of high-risk processes include •core processes: admission, transfer, discharge; •high-risk processes: medication delivery/administration, surgery; •high-risk patients: patients with reduced renal function, patients who are immunocompromised, neonates, patients in critical care units; •high-risk medications: heparin, insulin, chemotherapy, opiates; and •high-risk actions/interventions: blood transfusions, use of restraints, extracorporeal circulation","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_32"}}],["354",{"pageContent":"ised, neonates, patients in critical care units; •high-risk medications: heparin, insulin, chemotherapy, opiates; and •high-risk actions/interventions: blood transfusions, use of restraints, extracorporeal circulation.42 Key steps to implementing quality, safety, and performance improvement activities are as follows.42,43 These steps ensure success of the quality, safety, and performance improvement models described earlier. 1.Ensure leadership support and commitment for the quality, safety, and performance improvement initiative. 2.Assess priority and feasibility of initiatives based on risk, resources, leadership support, and organizational strategies and goals. 3.Identify the aim of the initiative and include the topic, process, or problem to be improved (have a good and justified rationale). 4.Convene an interdisciplinary team of content and process experts with all key disciplines as participants (involve all the right people and have a leadership sponsor and champion for the change). 5.Use tools and techniques to analyze processes, best practices, research, and consensus-based evidence for the desired change. 6.Develop the change to be implemented and add timelines and individual accountability for the project. 7.Identify the measure(s) that will demonstrate that the change resulted in improvement and set performance goals. 8.Educate staff on the desired change. 9.Implement and test the change via the redesigned processes. 10.Collect, analyze, and evaluate data on the redesigned process. 11.Make additional changes based on findings and disseminate to all areas. 12.Report and display results to reward staff on improvements. 13.Continue to monitor performance to ensure that the change is sustained. 14.Compare performance internally and externally. 15.Celebrate successes internally and externally. Today, quality, safety, and performance improvement projects call for perspectives beyond unit-based or team activities regardless of healthcare setting. The use of epidemiologic principles in healthcare quality grows as healthcare reform focuses on improving the health of the population, advancing quality of care for the individual, and containing costs—the Triple Aim44 and more recently, workforce engagement and workforce safety.45 This requires looking at the distribution and determinants of health status and disease states.

There are different types of performance measures. Before selecting a measure, one must understand what purpose each measure serves. It is helpful to scan existing quality measures to identify those that are valid and reliable (e.g., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS], AHRQ, National Quality Forum [NQF], and NCQA). Look for measures vetted through consensus-driven processes involving various stakeholders, including patient and families. The benefit of using an existing and tested measure is there is evidence to support the fidelity in assessing the structure, process, or outcome of care. •Structure: measures of infrastructure, capacity, systems, and processes (e.g., nurse staffing ratios). •Process: measures of process performance. They tell whether the parts or steps in the system are performing as planned. This can be “in process” or “end of process” (e.g., timely administration of prophylactic surgical antibiotics). •Outcome: measures that show results of overall process or system performance (often risk adjusted, e.g., mortality). Further guidance on evaluating and selecting quality measures is offered by McGlynn47(9) and summarized below. •Important—is the measure assessing an aspect of efficiency that is important to providers, payers, and policymakers? Has the measure been applied at the level of interest to those planning to use the measure? Is there an opportunity for improvement? Is the measure under the control of the provider or health system? •Scientifically sound—is the measure reliable and reproducible? Does the measure appear to capture the concept of interest? Is there evidence of face, construct, or predictive validity? •Feasible—are the data necessary to construct this measure available? Is the cost and burden of measurement reasonable? •Actionable—are the results interpretable?

There are many quality measures that are vetted and readily available for use by healthcare quality professionals to employ in their improvement efforts. For example, clinical quality measures (CQMs) were designed to be measures of process, access, outcome, structure, and patient experience to assess the quality of care provided by physicians and other healthcare professionals for Medicare and Medicaid populations. Implementation of these measures was a requirement for providers to attain both Stage 1 and Stage 2 Meaningful Use. CMS provides annual updates that document specifications for an evolving set of electronic CQMs that can be gathered from EHRs.48 These measures can help providers and organizations report on quality, advancing care information and improvement activities. Further, CMS Conditions of Participation require a data-driven performance improvement program in hospitals and within the next few years will include all healthcare providers. The AHRQ developed a suite of measures: AHRQ Quality Indicator modules.49 Software is available for users to apply AHRQ QI to their organization’s administrative data. AHRQ QI modules include prevention, inpatient, patient safety, and pediatric. AHRQ also maintains a National Quality Measures Clearinghouse, a resource of evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. Other efforts funded by AHRQ have also brought a focus on more rigorous quality and performance-based data, analytics, improvement science, and implementation research. Another major source of quality measures can be found at the NQF. The NQF endorsed over 300 measures that are used in federal public reporting and pay-for-performance programs as well as in private-sector and state programs. Measures that focus specifically on health plans are published by NCQA. NCQA’s Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) are measures used by more than 90% of America’s health plans to assess performance on multiple dimensions of care and service.

Examples of measures include the skin integrity and changes in skin integrity; functional status, cognitive function, and changes in function; transfer of health information and care preferences for transitions between levels of care; and, all-condition risk-adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmissions rates. AHRQ is instrumental in advancing the study of measures, especially outcomes and the effectiveness of specific treatments. Criteria have been developed for the selection of measures based on attributes52 that include the following: •Standardization: Report the same kind of data in the same way. •Comparability: If appropriate, results are risk adjusted for factors (e.g., age, gender, health status). •Availability: Data will be available. •Timeliness: Results will be available when most needed. •Relevance: Results measure concerns of stakeholders and users. •Validity: Measures have been tested so they consistently and accurately reflect the measure. •Experience: Organizations have experience with the measure so it reflects actual performance. •Stability: The measure is not likely to be removed from use. •Evaluability: The measure can be evaluated as better or worse. •Distinguishability: The measure denotes differences between organizations. •Credibility: The measures can be audited.

To determine the goodness, there are several factors to consider. Does the evidence pre-establish the desired or expected performance level? If not, does any regulatory, accreditation, or payer agencies identify a desired or expected performance level? The use of comparative data helps set desired targets or goals and provides a method by which to determine how well the organization is performing compared with similar organizations, competitors, best in the industry, and best in class. To support quality, safety, and performance improvement and other administrative functions, many organizations have moved in the direction of building large data warehouses that include information from all systems in the organization. For example, these data warehouses contain clinical, operational, financial, and human resources data. The data warehouses are supported by hardware (e.g., servers) and database software that combines the information into integrated data tables. The ability to integrate these data allows for robust reporting and analyses. Data collection can be both expensive and time-consuming for any organization. Just enough data are collected; avoid p. 218 p. 219 over-measurement in terms of both number of measures and frequency of measurement and analysis. Healthcare quality professionals can prevent duplicate data collection efforts among different groups and departments. It is preferable to pilot a new data collection process, even if it is new only to the organization. The development of a comprehensive data collection plan for improvement activities can leverage the warehouse and conserve resources. Planning includes the following steps: •Determine the who, what, when, where, why, and how. •Structure the design. •Choose and develop the sampling method. •Determine and conduct the necessary training. •Delegate responsibilities and communicate timelines. •Facilitate interdepartmental/cross-functional coordination. •Forecast the budget requirements. •Conduct pilot procedures for the forms and the data collection","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_37"}}],["359",{"pageContent":"the sampling method. •Determine and conduct the necessary training. •Delegate responsibilities and communicate timelines. •Facilitate interdepartmental/cross-functional coordination. •Forecast the budget requirements. •Conduct pilot procedures for the forms and the data collection process. Connected to the data warehouse is usually at least one business intelligence (BI) tool that allows end users, including quality, safety, and performance improvement staff, to create their own reports. The BI tools have the capability to filter data by diagnosis, location, or provider and produce sophisticated tables, graphs, and analyses. These tools also allow for trending over time and comparisons of different groups. Utilizing the BI tool enables the capability to analyze baseline information before a QI project starts, look at trends over time, and measure the impact of improve efforts. Further, analytical tools, such as R, SAS, or SPSS can be used on the data available in the warehouse to test for significant changes, control for varying patient characteristics, and build predictive models. See Performance and Process Improvement and Patient Safety for more information on evaluation and measures. Data Types There are two general types of data: measurement/continuous and count/categorical. Ordinal data are a form of categorical data. Methods of sampling, data collection, and analysis are different for each type or level of data. This distinction is critical because quality, safety, and performance improvement work involves both types of data and their associated statistics. It is one of the most significant sources of confusion for people new to performance improvement and data analysis. Data levels are categorical (nominal and ordinal) and continuous (interval and ratio). Categorical Nominal. Nominal data are also called count, discrete, or qualitative data. In statistical process control (SPC) these are known as attributes data. Binary data are categorical data with only two possibilities (e.g., gender). Numerical values can be assigned to each category as a label to facilitate data analysis, but this is purely arbitrary with no quantitative value. There is no order to these data. Examples of nominal scale data are shown in TABLE 4-8.

Continuous or “measured” data are assigned scales that theoretically have no gaps. The SPC term for this is p. 219 p. 220 variables data. There are two subtypes of continuous data: interval and ratio. •Interval. For interval-level data, the distance between each point is equal and there is no true zero (e.g., the values on a Fahrenheit thermometer). •Ratio. For ratio-level data, the distance between each point is equal and there is a true zero (e.g., height and weight). Measurement/continuous data often can be converted to count/categorical data. For example, the number of pounds lost by a patient undergoing hemodialysis during treatment in relationship to his or her desired or “dry weight” is measurement data. If Mr. Jones was admitted at 170 lb and was discharged at his dry weight of 165 lb, then he measured a 5-lb weight loss. If the nurse manager wanted to know the number of patients finishing their treatments at their “dry weight” for the entire day, then this information would be an example of count data and would be converted into “yes/no” format. A critical issue is whether the right data are measured or counted. A common criticism of quality, safety, and performance improvement activities is that readily available data, such as patient visits, deaths, infections, falls, cost, and laboratory tests, are analyzed for improvement specifically because the data are easy to retrieve. Statistical Power Categorical data are the least powerful statistically, and continuous data have the most power.

The practical meaning of this when comparing patient outcomes after process change is that fewer data points (and fewer subjects) are needed if data in continuous form are collected, if the researcher has a choice. For example, when dealing with blood pressure, a healthcare quality manager might collect the data by categorizing subjects as either hypertensive or non-hypertensive, or by recording the measured levels of systolic and diastolic pressure. The latter form is more powerful and allows more flexibility in data analysis. When a quality, safety, and performance improvement project is designed, each step must be planned and accountability assigned. Each organization can adopt an improvement model that facilitates performance improvement and is in alignment with its mission, vision, core values, goals, and strategic plan (for more information, see Organizational Leadership and Performance and Process Improvement). Sampling Design A population (N) is the total aggregate or group (e.g., all cases that meet a designated set of criteria for practitioners, all patients who died at a particular hospital, or all registered nurses with a tenure of 10 years or longer). Sampling makes research more feasible because it allows researchers to sample a portion of the population to represent the entire population (n). A sample usually is selected from the accessible population; that is, the population that is available. Sampling has several primary purposes, including providing a logical way of making statements about a larger group based on a smaller group and allowing researchers to make inferences or generalize from the sample to the population if the selection process was random and systematic (i.e., unbiased). Types of Sampling There are different methods that might be used to create a sample. Generally, they are grouped into one of two categories described below: probability sampling and nonprobability sampling. p. 220 p. 221 Probability. Probability sampling requires every element in the population to have an equal or random chance of being selected for inclusion in the sample. The following are subsets of probability sampling: •Simple random sampling. Everyone in the sampling frame (all subjects in the population) has an equal chance of being chosen (e.g., pulling a name out of a hat containing all possible names). •Systematic sampling. After randomly selecting the first case, this method involves drawing every nth element from a population. For example, picking every third name from a list of possible names. •Stratified random sampling. A subpopulation is a stratum, and strata are two or","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_40"}}],["362",{"pageContent":"the first case, this method involves drawing every nth element from a population. For example, picking every third name from a list of possible names. •Stratified random sampling. A subpopulation is a stratum, and strata are two or more homogeneous subpopulations. After the population is divided into strata, each member of a stratum has an equal probability of being selected. Examples of strata include sex, ethnicity, patients with certain diseases, or patients living in certain parts of the country. •Cluster sampling. This method requires that the population be divided into groups, or clusters. For example, if a researcher is studying medical students, they may not have individual names but may have a list of medical schools in the area. The sample may be randomly derived from this list of medical schools. Nonprobability. Nonprobability sampling provides no way of estimating the probability that each element will be included in the sample. When this approach is used, the results will be representative of the sample only and cannot be generalized to the available population. The following are subsets of nonprobability sampling: •Convenience sampling. This approach allows the use of any available group of subjects. Because of the lack of randomization in this sampling method, subjects may be atypical in some way. Sending a survey to a list of members of an elder organization may not reflect the opinions of all elders, for example. Convenience sampling may include all patients at an organization who are undergoing a certain procedure over a 12-month period. Selection bias may be present in all convenience sampling because the selected subjects may not accurately reflect the population of interest. •Snowball sampling. This is a subtype of convenience sampling. This method involves subjects suggesting other subjects for inclusion in the study so the sampling process gains momentum. With this type of sampling, subjects are recruited who are difficult to identify but are known to others because of an informal network. •Purposive or judgment sampling. This method selects a group or groups based on certain criteria. This method is subjective, and the researcher uses their judgment to decide who is representative of the population. Using a group of nurses, because the researcher believes the group represents a cross-section of women, is an example of this type of sampling. •Expert sampling. This is a type of purposive sampling that involves selecting experts in each area because of their access to the information relevant to the study.

This is a type of purposive sampling that involves selecting experts in each area because of their access to the information relevant to the study. Expert sampling is used in the Delphi technique, in which several rounds of questionnaires are distributed on a selected topic and sent to experts to elicit their responses and then sent out again after the initial data analysis. The goal is to achieve rapid group consensus. A conference planning team serves as an example if it uses the Delphi method to identify potential program content that may be of interest to those in the same professions for an upcoming conference. •Quota sampling. In this type of sampling, the researcher makes a judgment decision about the best type of sample for the investigation. That is, the researcher pre-specifies characteristics of the sample to increase its representativeness. The researcher identifies strata of the population and determines the proportions of elements needed from various segments of the population. Stratification may be based on any demographic, such as age or ethnicity. Sample Size Many factors may influence the determination of sample size, such as research purpose, design, level of confidence desired, anticipated degree of difference between study groups, and size of the population. Depending on these factors, a small or large sample size may be appropriate. However, except for case studies, the larger the sample, the more valid and accurate the study because a larger sample size is more likely to represent the population. The larger the sample, the smaller the sample error of the mean, which is a measure of fluctuation of a statistic from one sample to another drawn from the same population. Also, as the actual difference between study groups gets smaller, the size of the sample required to detect the difference gets larger. Outcomes that are measured on a continuous scale or using repeated measures require fewer subjects than do categorical outcomes. Using too large a sample to answer a research question is a waste of time and resources. Variation Use of an SPC chart clarifies and interprets a function or process. The performance of functions or processes varies over time. This variation is expected and predictable and is referred to as random or common-cause variation. A process is said to be “in control” if the variation is within the computed p. 221 p. 222 upper and lower limits and no trends are evident. There is no need to act if a process is in control.

There is no need to act if a process is in control. Special-cause variation occurs when activity falls outside the control limits or there is an obvious nonrandom pattern around the central line. This type of variation is interpreted as a trend and investigated. Trends When a trend is identified for a measure in an unanticipated direction, an investigation is initiated to determine the cause (e.g., RCA). For example, if the 30-day readmission rate is climbing 1% every month for a 6-month period there might be change in practice that needs to be addressed. In this case, an inter-professional team may be convened to further analyze and improve the process that is causing the increase. The team uses performance improvement principles and tools (e.g., histograms, flowcharts, Pareto charts, cause-and-effect diagrams, run charts; for more information, see Performance and Process Improvement). After thorough analysis of the process, the team selects and implements appropriate corrective measures. Comparison Groups One of the biggest challenges in making conclusions in the evaluation of QI interventions is the lack on “true” comparison group. While looking for changes over time is useful, there is more value in comparing to a group that did not get the intervention (e.g., change in process). Since random assignment to different groups is usually not possible, selecting a comparison group is based on convenience. For example, it might be possible to test a new standard of practice (i.e., intervention) to reduce pressure ulcers on several nursing units while maintaining the current practice on other nursing units (i.e., control). The problem is the patients on the units might not be the same. One approach to dealing with this problem is to use propensity score matching.53 Propensity score matching is a multivariate approach to pairing up people with the same characteristics in the intervention and control groups to eliminate potential impact of variation between the groups that are not equal. Propensity score matching is an effective approach to equating groups and a tool that quality, safety, and performance improvement teams consider when analyzing data. Measurement Tools Instruments are the devices that healthcare quality professionals and researchers use to obtain and record data received from the subjects. These instruments can include questionnaires, surveys, rating scales, interview transcripts, and the like.

These instruments can include questionnaires, surveys, rating scales, interview transcripts, and the like. It is critical to use the most credible tools possible (those with proven reliability and validity). Reliability Reliability is the extent to which an experiment, test, or measuring procedure yields the same results on repeated trials. For example, a scale that measures a person’s weight as 110 lb one minute and then yields a reading of 160 lb a minute later would be considered unreliable and not capable of meeting the standards for accuracy or consistency. •Reliability coefficient. The stability of an instrument is derived through procedures referred to as test–retest reliability. This is done by administering the test to a sample of people on two occasions and then comparing the scores obtained. The comparison results in a reliability coefficient, which is the numerical index of the test’s reliability. The closer the coefficient is to 1.0, the more reliable the tool. In general, reliability coefficients of ≥0.70 are considered acceptable, although ≥0.80 is desired. The reliability coefficient can be determined by evaluating the internal consistency of a measure. This refers to the degree to which the subparts of an instrument are all measuring the same attribute or dimension. The “split-half” technique is one of the oldest methods for assessing internal consistency of an instrument and can be done by hand. It correlates scores on half of the measure with scores on the other half. The concept of reliability by equivalence is established by comparing scores from the various versions of the instrument that have been developed (e.g., parallel forms or alternate forms of a test). This concept is used to compare different translations of a measurement tool or different forms of the Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality (CPHQ) examination, for example. •Interrater reliability. This concept refers to the degree to which two raters, operating independently, assign the same ratings in the context of observational research or in coding qualitative materials. The monitoring of the accuracy of a patient acuity system entails interrater reliability. The staff that monitors the system must be able to assign the same classification to the same patient to ensure reliability of their monitoring. Interrater reliability frequently is reported as a degree of concordance, or Cohen’s kappa. Validity Validity is the degree to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. Validity usually is more difficult to establish than reliability. The validity and reliability of an instrument are not wholly independent of each other.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\HQ Solutions - Resource for the Healthcare Quality Professional - Section 4 - Health Data Analytics_44"}}],["366",{"pageContent":"or Cohen’s kappa. Validity Validity is the degree to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. Validity usually is more difficult to establish than reliability. The validity and reliability of an instrument are not wholly independent of each other. An instrument that is not reliable cannot possibly be valid. However, an instrument that is reliable does not have to have validity. For example, a thermometer is a reliable instrument, but it is not valid for measuring height. p. 222 p. 223 •Content (face) validity. This is the degree to which the instrument adequately represents the universe of content. Content validity, although necessary, is not a sufficient indication that the instrument measures what it is intended to measure. For example, a panel of rehabilitation specialists evaluated the functional independence measure (FIM™) tool and identified that it measured the key aspects of functional independence. On the other hand, a survey designed to measure patient satisfaction with their primary care provider would be considered inadequate in terms of content validity if it failed to cover the major dimensions of access, waiting time, practitioner–patient interaction, or engagement. Content validity includes judgments by experts or respondents about the degree to which a test appears to measure the relevant construct. •Construct validity. This concept refers to the degree to which an instrument measures the theoretical construct or trait that it was designed to measure. For example, severity-adjustment scales are tools for measuring staffing needs. Risk-adjustment scales are tools for predicting the probability of outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. If a previously used satisfaction tool had demonstrated validity, a new, abbreviated tool can be compared to the “old” tool to determine whether the new tool has construct validity. Similarly, two functional status health outcome measures could be compared, such as the SF-36 and SF-12 instruments. •Criterion-related validity. This concept refers to the extent that the score on an instrument can be related to a criterion (the behavior that the instrument is supposed to predict). Criterion-related validity can be either predictive or concurrent, depending on when the criterion variable is measured. If the criterion variable is obtained at the same time as the measurement under study, concurrent validity is assessed. If the criterion measure is obtained at some future time (after the predictor instrument was used), predictive validity is assessed. A patient acuity system has criterion-related validity because it predicts staffing needs (skill mix and number of staff required).

Measures of Central Tendency Measures of central tendency are statistical indexes that describe where a set of scores or values of a distribution cluster. Central refers to the middle value, and tendency refers to the general trend of the numbers. A healthcare quality manager or researcher might ask questions relating to central tendency when answering queries such as, “What is the average LOS for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?” or “What is the Apgar score of most infants born in the new birthing suites?” The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, the median, and the mode. The type and distribution of the data determine which measures of central tendency (and spread) are most appropriate. Mean. The mean (M) of a set of measurements is the sum of all scores or values divided by the total number of scores. The mean is also known as the average. Example: If five infants had Apgar scores of 7, 8, 8, 9, and 8, the sum of the values is calculated, and then divided by the total number of infants: 7 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 8 = 40; 40 ÷ 5 = 8; therefore, 8 is the mean. The mean is the most commonly used of all the measures of central tendency, but it is the most sensitive to extreme scores. In the example given above, if one infant was severely depressed at the time of Apgar scoring and was given a value of 1 instead of 9, the mean then would be 6.4 rather than 8. In this case, the mean is no longer representative of the entire group because it was substantially lowered by just one score. The median, described below would be a better statistic to use. It is appropriate to compute the mean for interval or ratio data when variables can be added and the values show a bell-shaped or normal distribution. The mean also can be used with ordinal variables that have an approximately normal distribution.

It is appropriate to compute the mean for interval or ratio data when variables can be added and the values show a bell-shaped or normal distribution. The mean also can be used with ordinal variables that have an approximately normal distribution. Median. median is the measure of central tendency that corresponds to the middle score; that is, the point on a numerical scale above which and below which 50% of the cases fall. To determine the median of data, first arrange the values in rank order. If the total of values is odd, count up (or down) to the middle value. If there are several identical values clustered at the middle, the median is that value. If the total number of values is even, compute the mean of the two middle values. Example: Consider the following set of values: 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 6 8 9. The median for this set of numbers is 4.5, which is the value that divides the set exactly in half. Note that an important characteristic of the median is that the calculation does not consider the quantitative values of the individual scores. An example of this notion can be demonstrated in the sample above. If the last value of 9 were increased to the value 84, the median would remain the same because it does not enter the computation of the median; only the number of values and the values near the midpoint of the distribution enter the computation. The median, consequently, is not sensitive to extreme scores or statistical outliers. It is appropriate to p. 223 p. 224 compute the median for ordinal, interval, or ratio data, but not for nominal data. Mode. The mode is the score or value that occurs most frequently in a distribution of scores. Of the three measures of central tendency, the mode is the easiest to determine; simply determine which value occurs most often in the data set. Example: Look at the following distribution of numbers: 30 31 31 32 33 33 33 33 33 34 35 36. It is easy to determine that the mode is 33; the value of 33 appears five times, a higher frequency than for any other number. An easy way to determine the mode is by using a statistical package to run descriptive data frequencies and/or a stem-and-leaf plot.

An easy way to determine the mode is by using a statistical package to run descriptive data frequencies and/or a stem-and-leaf plot. In research studies, the mode is seldom the only measure of central tendency reported. Modes are viewed as a quick and easy method to determine an “average,” but they tend to be unstable. This instability means that the modes tend to fluctuate widely from sample to sample, even when drawn from the same population. Thus, the mode is reported infrequently, except when used as a descriptor for “typical” values on nominal data. For example, a research report may describe the sample population demographic data as follows: “The typical respondent was a Hispanic man who was married.” Measures of Variability In the preceding section the purpose of measuring the central tendencies of data was to describe the ways subjects or cases group together. In contrast, variability looks at the dispersion, or how the measures are spread out. Variability further may be defined as the degree to which values on a set of scores differ. For example, it is expected that there is greater variability of age within a hospital than within a nursing home or pediatric intensive care unit. Measures of variability are interpreted as distances on a scale of values, which are unlike averages that are points representing a central value. The three measures of variability that are presented in this review are the range, SD, and interpercentile measures. Range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a distribution of scores. Although it indicates the distance on the score scale between the lowest and highest values, the range is best reported as the values themselves and not as the distance between the values. Range offers advantages: It is a quick estimate of variability and it provides information about the two endpoints of a distribution. Disadvantages of range include its instability because it is based on only two scores: its tendency to increase with sample size, and its sensitivity to extreme values. Example: Test scores for students range from 98 to 60. The range is 98 minus 60, or 38. When the range is reported in research findings, it normally would be written as a maximum and a minimum, without the subtracted value. Standard Deviation. SD, an average of the deviations from the mean, is the most frequently used statistic for measuring the degree of variability in a set of scores.

SD, an average of the deviations from the mean, is the most frequently used statistic for measuring the degree of variability in a set of scores. Standard refers to the fact that the deviation indicates a group’s average spread of scores or values around their mean; deviation indicates how much each score is scattered from the mean. The larger the spread of a distribution, the greater the dispersion or variability from the mean; consequently, the SD will be a larger value and is said to be heterogeneous. The more the values cluster around the mean, the smaller the amount of variability or deviation and the more homogeneous the group is said to be and it will have a smaller SD. The standard bell curve illustrates this measure of variability (FIG. 4-2). A histogram can be used to display data distribution and to determine if data are normally distributed. When computing the SD, as with the mean, all the scores or values in a distribution are taken into consideration. Use of the SD is most appropriate with normally distributed interval or ratio scale data. SDs (and means) also may be calculated for normally distributed values from a broad ordinal scale. SDs can be calculated by hand or with statistical software. Figure 4-2 Normal distribution. Example: The researcher may compare coping-scale scores for two groups of patients, with each group having a different p. 224 p. 225 ethnic background. Although each distribution demonstrated a mean score of 30, the SDs were computed at 3 and 8, respectively. The investigator could conclude that although the means were alike, one sample was more homogeneous (or had less variance) in its coping skills. Interpercentile Measures. Although there are several interpercentile measures of variability, the most common is the interquartile range, a stable measure of variability based on excluding extreme scores and using only middle cases. The interquartile range is more stable than the range and is determined by lining up the measures in order of size and then dividing the array into quarters. The range of scores that includes the middle 50% of the scores is the interquartile range; that is, the range between scores comprising the lowest quartile, or quarter, and the highest quartile. The interquartile range demonstrates how the middle 50% of the distribution is scattered. The first quartile ends at the 25th percentile.

Example: Clinical pathways are developed based on the interquartile range of the designated population. Paths can be designed around the average patient or those in the middle quartiles. Statistical Tests Significance tests are categorized as either parametric or nonparametric. Parametric tests are used with data measured on a continuous scale (i.e., interval or ratio data, which also are known as variables data). Nonparametric tests are used with categorical (attributes) data and used with ordinal data, especially if the ordinal categories have a small range of possible values or a non-normal distribution.

Parametric tests are based on assumptions about the distribution of the underlying population from which the sample was taken. The most common parametric assumption is that data are approximately normally distributed.54 t-Test. The t-test assesses whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other. When determining whether the difference between two group means is significant, a distinction must be made regarding the two groups. The two groups may be independent; that is, a control group and an experimental group, or they can be dependent, wherein a single group yields pretreatment and posttreatment scores. Example: A healthcare quality manager wants to test the effect of a special educational program on departmental heads’ attitudes toward using graphical or visual displays of data in their performance improvement team meeting. Ten of the 20 department heads are randomly assigned to an experiment group, which will be exposed to videos, discussion groups, and lectures on the use of the basic quality control tools and management and planning tools. The remaining 10 department heads comprise the control group, which will not receive special instruction on using the tools. At the end of the experiment, both groups are administered a scale measuring attitudes toward using these tools. The two-sample independent t-test helps the researcher determine if there was a significant statistical difference between the two groups (i.e., whether any difference was due to chance). Alternatively, if all 20 department heads received the training with pre- and post-training testing scores, the statistical significance of any changes in average scores would be measured using a “paired sample” t-test.

Regression Analysis. Regression analysis is based on statistical correlations, or associations among variables. A correlation between two variables is used to evaluate the usefulness of a prediction equation. If this correlation were perfect (i.e., r= 1 or r = –1), it would be possible to make a perfect prediction about the score on one variable given the score on the other variable. Unfortunately, this is never the case because there never are perfect correlations; consequently, it never is possible to make perfect predictions. The higher the correlation between variables, the more accurate the degree of prediction. If there were no correlation between two variables (i.e., r = 0), knowing the score of one would not help to estimate the score on the other. In simple linear regression, one variable (x) is used to predict a second variable (y). For example, simple regression can be used to predict weight based on height or to predict response to a diabetes management program. Regression analysis is performed with the intent to make predictions about phenomena. The ability to make accurate predictions has substantial implications in the healthcare industry. Multiple Regression Analysis. Multiple regression analysis estimates the effects of two or more independent variables (x) on a dependent measure (y). For example, the objective may be to predict intravenous (IV) site infiltration (y) based on predictors (x), which may include osmolarity of the IV solution and addition of an irritating medication, such as potassium, to the IV. Nonparametric Tests. One might define nonparametric statistical procedures as a class of statistical procedures that do not rely on assumptions about the shape or form of the probability distribution from which the data were drawn.54 Chi-Square (χ2) Tests and Categorical (Attributes) Data. Much of the data collected by healthcare quality professionals is counted, not measured. Being counted (e.g., 15 male and 30 female patients in the clinic today) means that many arithmetic operations do not apply (it is not possible to calculate the average gender of patients). But it certainly is possible to describe the ratio of the counts (e.g., there were twice as many woman as men in the clinic today) or to compare proportions with counted data (50% of male vs. 75% of female patients, came for their appointments today). The chi-square test (χ2) measures the statistical significance of a difference in proportions and is the most commonly reported statistical test in the medical literature.

The chi-square test (χ2) measures the statistical significance of a difference in proportions and is the most commonly reported statistical test in the medical literature. It is the easiest statistical test to calculate manually (see the CAN’T MISS series). It is a statistical test commonly used to compare observed data with data that one would expect to obtain per a specific hypothesis. Example: Using the previously furnished appointment data, 15 of 30 men (50%) with appointments failed to keep them, while only 10 of 40 women (25%) failed to appear. The referent rate of missed appointments in men would be 0.5/0.25 = 2 (i.e., men are twice as likely to not show up as women). While that may or may not fit the hypothesis about men’s behavior in this situation, the statistical question is whether this 25% difference in the proportion of no-shows might have happened by chance sampling (in this case, scheduling might be causing the difference). The null hypothesis is that men and women fail to show up for appointments at about the same rate (i.e., rate = 1). Thus, χ2 tests indicate the likelihood of noting a twofold difference in no-shows between the groups if in fact men and women fail to keep their appointments at the same rate. The actual χ2 value (test statistic) for these data is 5.84, which corresponds to a statistical significance (p) value of less than 0.02, meaning fewer than 2 out of every 100 days would result in a schedule with which men were twice as likely to not show up. In other words, there is a 2% probability that the difference in no-shows by gender is due to chance, but there is a 98% probability the difference is due to some other factor or factors. p. 226 p. 227 Tests of Significance. Tests for statistical significance are used to determine the probability that a relationship between two variables is just a chance occurrence. Discussed here are confidence interval (CI) and level of significance. Confidence Interval.

CIs commonly are used when comparing groups, but they also have other applications. They reflect the uncertainty that always is present when working with samples of subjects. The sample estimate(s) are a best guess about the true value of interest. For example, continuing the missed appointment example above, it is estimated that 50% of men miss their appointments, but the true value may be higher or lower. There is similar uncertainty about the true proportion of women who miss their appointments and about the ratio of the men’s and women’s proportions. Using the measure of variation from a sample, it is possible to construct a CI that, with a stated level of probability, holds the true value of interest. Example: It was observed (hypothetically) that men are twice as likely to miss their appointments as women. The 95% CI around the referent rate of 2 is (1.27 to 3.13), meaning there is 95% certainty that men are between 1.27 and 3.13 times more likely to miss their appointment. A lower level of confidence would include a narrower range of values. For example, the 90% CI around the referent rate for the appointment data would be (1.44 to 2.77). Level of Significance. The level of significance (p) gives the probability of observing a difference as large as the one found in a study when, in fact, there is no true difference between the groups (i.e., when the null hypothesis is true). A small p value indicates a small chance that the null hypothesis is true and favors the alternative hypothesis that there is a significance between the two groups. Historically, when the p value is less than 0.05, healthcare quality managers and researchers declared their results statistically significant and “rejected the null hypothesis.” Example: The p value for the ratio of missed appointment rates above was 0.02, so it was concluded that there was little evidence that men and women had the same rate of missed appointments (“the null”) and determined that men probably had a higher rate of missed appointments. How much higher? There is 95% confidence that the odds ratio lies between 1.27 and 3.13 times more likely to miss their appointments (see the CI example above).

Described next are decision-making methods and tools, SPC, and types of variation, and examples of these tools. Methods and Tools The management of data, analysis of information, and management through knowledge are necessary to change and improve healthcare organizations. For the tools to be successful, a strong team facilitator is necessary. Many tools are useful in the analysis of current processes and the design of new processes; this discussion is not meant to be all-inclusive. Various charts and diagrams can be used by healthcare professionals when considering the data collected to make sense of them. These tools typically represent the data in a visual way to assist stakeholders in making decisions about improvement. Activity Network Diagram This tool also is known as an arrow diagram (FIG. 4-3) (in industry it also is called the program evaluation and review technique or a critical path method chart). In the arrow diagram, arrows connect articles (nodes) that represent a start and finish of activities. The arrows themselves represent the activities to be completed. Using the arrow diagram, a sequence of events is depicted. It is useful when several simultaneous paths must be coordinated. How to construct 1.List all the necessary tasks, one per card, to complete a project from start to finish. 2.Use the cards to sequence the activities for each path. 3.Identify the places in the paths where there are connections with other paths. These places identify parts of one path that cannot be initiated until a point in another path is reached. 4.Determine the time duration for each task. 5.Calculate the shortest possible time to complete the project. 6.Review and revise the diagram as needed. When to use •When a task is complex or crucial to an organization •When simultaneous implementation of several paths must be coordinated Figure 4-3 Activity network diagram. p. 227 p. 228 Stratification Chart Stratification charts (FIG. 4-4) are designed to show where a problem does and does not occur or to demonstrate underlying patterns.

How to construct 1.Examine the process to identify characteristics that could lead to biases and systematic differences in your results. 2.Enter data onto data collection forms (such as day of week or month, shifts or workers). 3.Look for patterns related to time and sequence.

When to use •Before data collection to know what difference or patterns to look for •After data collection to determine which factors affected the results Figure 4-4 Stratification charts. Histogram or Bar Chart Before further analyzing a data set, the distribution of values for each of the variables is reviewed (FIG. 4-5). The optimal tool for reviewing a distribution depends on the amount of information. A bar chart with a separate bar for each value may be used when data are sparse (e.g., fewer than 12 values), but, as the data increase, it becomes p. 228 p. 229 necessary to organize and summarize them. Histograms are a specialized type of bar graph used to summarize groups of data. It is the most commonly used frequency distribution tool that presents the measurement scale of values along the x axis (each bar is equal-sized interval) and the frequency scale along the y axis (counts or percentages). Plotting the frequency of each interval reveals the pattern of the data, showing their center and spread (including outliers) and whether there is symmetry or skew. This is important information because it may reveal problems in the data and may influence the choice of measure of central tendency and spread.

When to use •Show the data distribution or spread •Show whether the data are symmetric shape (approximately the same on both sides) or skewed (right or left) •Show whether there are extreme data values (outliers) Figure 4-5 Histogram or bar chart. An important distinction must be made regarding bar charts and histograms. With a bar chart, the x axis consists of discrete categories (each bar is a separate group). An example of this would be plotting systolic blood pressure >140 by ethnic group. The height of the bar represents the frequency of elevated blood pressure for each 1 mm Hg change in each ethnic group. A histogram’s x axis is divided into categories using equally sized ranges of values along the axis. The variable is measured on a continuous scale, and the bars are not separated by gaps. To continue with the systolic blood pressure example, the groupings of the x axis could be equal-sized, with ranges defined, for example, as 90 to 99, 100 to 119, or 120 to 129 mmHg. Histograms can be constructed manually or automatically with various statistical software programs. Pie Chart Pie charts (FIG. 4-6) are useful for understanding all the responses on a measure, usually expressed as percentages.

Pareto Diagram/Pareto Chart A Pareto diagram or chart (FIG. 4-7) displays a series of bars with which the priority for problem solving can easily be seen by the varying height of the bars. The tallest bar is the most frequently occurring issue. The bars always are arranged in descending height. This tool is related to the Pareto principle (named after the 19th-century economist Vilfredo Pareto), which states that 80% of the problems or effects come from 20% of the causes. Therefore, by tackling 20% of the most frequent causes, an 80% improvement can be achieved.

Trends generally indicate a statistically important event that needs further analysis. Resist the tendency to see every variation in the data as significant; wait to interpret the results until at least 10 (or even better, 20) data points are plotted. As indicated in this example, it is best to not analyze data too frequently. For example, looking at quarterly data may more accurately reflect trends over time than reviewing data monthly. Statistical Process Control SPC is an approach to monitoring quality by looking at whether a process or outcome is within the bounds of what is expected. Control charts are typically used to visualize data to detect p. 230 p. 231 and prevent problems. There are two basic types of control charts—univariate control chart that is a graphical display (chart) of one quality characteristic and multivariate control chart that is a graphical display of a statistic that summarizes or represents more than one quality characteristic. Control charts are run charts to which control limits have been added above and below the center line (mean). These lines are calculated from the data and show the range of variation in the output of a process. In general, upper control limits (UCLs) and lower control limits (LCLs) are determined by adding and subtracting three SDs to or from the mean. Assuming a normal distribution and no special-cause variation 99% of data points would be expected to fall between the UCL and LCL. There are many types of control charts for both variable and attributes data. •Variables data: 1 Range Bar chart, median and range chart, x and s chart, XmR chart, moving average chart; •Attributes data: P chart, NP chart, U chart, C chart. One common chart presents individual values (X) and calculates limits based on the moving range (mR); this is the XmR chart. The XmR chart is used when data are obtained on a periodic basis, such as once a day or once a week, which is common in quality and performance improvement activities.

When to use •Distinguish variation from common and special causes •Assist with eliminating special-cause variation •Observe effects of a process improvement Figure 4-11 Control chart. Types of Variation By design, control charts are very useful in identifying variation in quality measures. The challenge for the healthcare quality professional is determining whether what they are seeing is common or special-cause variation so that appropriate action can be taken. •Common-cause variation. Variation is inherent in any process. p. 231 p. 232 On a control chart this type of variation is exhibited as points between the control limits in no particular pattern. This is variation that normally would be expected from a process. If this type of variation is treated as being unpredictable, it could tamper with the process and, in fact, make things worse. The root cause of the variation must be identified before trying to “fix” the problem. •Special-cause variation. Variation that arises from sources that are not inherent in the process are unpredictable. On a control chart this type of variation is exhibited as points that fall outside the control limits, or, when inside the control limits, exhibits certain patterns. These special-cause variations are addressed any time they occur with interventions appropriate to eliminate the special cause, if possible. Force Field Analysis. Force field analysis (FIG. 4-12) is a method to systematically identify the various forces that facilitate or increase the likelihood of success, and the opposite factors that decrease or restrain the likelihood of success or improvement in the process. This chart is like listing the pros and cons of an action. How to construct 1.Identify the issue. 2.Create two columns on a piece of paper.

Bell curves, histograms, and 2 × 2 tables are all types of frequency distributions (FIG. 4-13). When people describe a normal distribution, they are referring to a bell curve. Displaying the frequency distribution can help determine if one or more processes are occurring. For example, a frequency distribution can be a bimodal distribution of the ages of patients undergoing a total hip replacement. In other words, the data essentially have two different bell curves present and possibly two different processes. Conceivably, the demographics and risk factors may be different, and each age distribution may need a separate quality, safety or performance improvement focus.

Data-Driven Decision-Making The analysis, ultimate interpretation of data, and reporting are meaningful to various audiences. Good presentation of data creates interest and enhances understanding. Data are reported and analyzed on a regular basis. In this process, it is important to validate that the data were collected accurately. Data can be displayed in a format that is easily understood, and a summary provided. Those involved in the process being monitored are asked to help with the analysis. There is an analysis of variances and identification of unexpected p. 232 p. 233 p. 233 p. 234 patterns among caregivers, services, and patients.

The emphasis is telling stories through graphic representation of data.56 Common presentations of data discussed in the previous sections include the following: •Pareto diagram/chart: prioritizes a series of problems or possible causes of problems; •Histogram: illustrates the variability or distribution of data; •Scatter diagram: displays possible cause and effect, illustrates whether one variable might have an impact upon another variable, and can illustrate the strength of that impact; •Run chart: used to monitor processes over time; •Control chart: used to statistically illustrate upper and lower limits of a process and the variation of an organization’s process within those limits; and •Stratification: breaks down single values into meaningful categories or classifications to focus on improvement opportunities or corrective action.55 To effectively present data for interpretation and discussion, it is essential to provide a contextual background. Because most people are visually oriented, a graph is used to display data. A table of values can accompany the graph. There is an explanation of specifics regarding the data collection (how, when, and where the data were collected, and from whom they were obtained). There is a report summarizing the meaning of the values and how they were computed. If outliers were removed from the sample, that is stated. The time-order of the data collection can be included in the presentation to determine whether a pattern exists. Balanced Scorecards In 1992, Kaplan and Norton57 described a framework for performance improvement that relies on reporting key metrics representing all aspects of the business. The concept of the balanced scorecard is the presentation of a mixture of measures each compared to a target value. The target values can be set by the organization or be based on external benchmarks.

The concept of the balanced scorecard is the presentation of a mixture of measures each compared to a target value. The target values can be set by the organization or be based on external benchmarks. In reporting on quality, balanced scorecards can be developed that focus on multiple dimensions that underlie care delivery. For example, the key quality metrics typically can be grouped into the following domains: process, outcomes, utilization, and patient experience. A balanced scorecard would then have several measures in each of these domains with appropriate targets. One of the biggest benefits is that balanced scorecards can be used for easy communication of the quality measures to executives in the organization (e.g., Chief Executive ­Officer [CEO], Chief Medical Officer [CMO], Chief Nursing ­Officer [CNO], etc.). Examples of measures used in balanced scorecards can be found in FIGURE 4-14.

(Created by Christy L. Beaudin, PhD LCSW CPHQ for general education purposes. ©2011, 2012.) Dashboards Organizations often develop “Dashboards” to represent key management and performance indicators.58 As a decision support tool, the Dashboard can provide insights that are seldom seen with mere gut and intuition using a combination of the right metrics with visualization that will help “provide context and meaning that go beyond the buzzwords and technologies.”59(1) Dashboards can be used to analyze and forecast various organizational systems. These dashboards frequently incorporate external benchmarks, which allow organizations to compare performance to national, state, or regional norms. Benchmarks are available from CMS, state health department websites, medical specialty groups, published literature, and organizations such as The Leapfrog Group. An example is shown as FIGURE 4-15. Figure 4-15 Sample Core Metrics Dashboard. Source: Evaluation Dashboards. (nd). Maine State Innovation Model, Maine Department of Health and Human Services. http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/sim/evaluation/dashboard.shtml Benchmarking No matter what data display or reporting tool is used, benchmarking offers the organization to establish performance goals for administrative, financial, and clinical outcomes. The performance improvement team can determine whether it wants to be “average” (the industry standard) or raise the bar to a much higher level of performance. When comparison reveals differences, the healthcare organization’s management staff can begin to ask questions to determine the factors contributing to variances. Benchmarking includes routinely comparing indicators (structure, process, and outcomes) against best performance and seeking out ways to make improvements with the greatest impact on outcomes. It offers another approach to compare an organization’s or individual p. 234 p. 235 practitioner’s results against a reference point. Ideally, the reference point is a demonstrated best practice. Internal or external benchmarks can be used depending on the measure and what the organization is trying to accomplish.

Ideally, the reference point is a demonstrated best practice. Internal or external benchmarks can be used depending on the measure and what the organization is trying to accomplish. In their discussion about the use of benchmarking and continuous QI, Ettorchi-Tardy et al.,60(pe110) advantages of internal benchmarking are it is rapid, less expensive, and offers a learning method. For external benchmarking for clinical practices, some of the challenges might be specificity of the indicators to be used and how these practices might be compared against other healthcare organizations. External sources help develop best practices by implementing the same or similar processes to achieve better results. For example, an organization is focusing on improving vaccination rates among healthcare workers using the “timely and effective care: healthcare worker influenza vaccination” measure. Using Hospital Compare, the organization can assess progress in its vaccination rates with data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) tool. Another example is using Medical Office User Comparative Database Reports to identify key indicators for benchmarking from the Culture of Safety Survey. One of the most critical decisions an organization makes when launching a benchmarking initiative is selecting the source of comparative data. Organizations like Milliman have developed benchmarks for different aspects of operations such as efficiency benchmarks (the level of resource required for the completion of a defined number of transactions) and quality benchmarks (the level of consistency applied to similar transactions against recognized standards and the relative level of value of those services). According to p. 235 p. 236 p. 236 p. 237 Zolelzer,61 these performance benchmarks define the vision for what is possible in “Best Practice” operations and can identify strengths and weaknesses in operations and support operational improvement initiatives. Using Milliman’s administrative performance benchmarking, a health plan can analyze the efficiency of operational areas including claims, medical management, customer service, and administration and look at resource allocations in comparison to peers and competitors.61 FIGURE 4-16 illustrates benchmarks for administrative costs by functional area.

All rights reserved.) p. 237 p. 238 Healthcare quality professionals often coordinate an organization’s benchmarking efforts. Most healthcare regulatory agencies require benchmarking as part of a comprehensive quality, safety, and performance improvement program. Potential data sources for benchmarking include the following: •Government data available from CMS, the CDC, and state government agencies; •Alliances such as large healthcare systems (partnership organizations often provide data extrapolation for their members, frequently providing databases for internal and external benchmarking); •State peer review organizations and state hospital associations that offer free benchmarking opportunities for hospitals within their state; and •For-profit database companies that offer software that helps hospitals or organizations extrapolate and compile their own benchmark data or provide benchmarking data through a centralized database compiled by the company. These data are reported to regulatory and accreditation agencies as part of routine reporting (e.g., ORYX, Outcome and Assessment Information Set [OASIS], and HEDIS).

For example, reporting can include three documents shared across the organization and be used with different audiences. •First: a high-level presentation used in meetings to discuss the overall findings and outline suggestions for improvements. •Second: a one-page executive summary or infographic shared broadly and summarizes the project, findings, and improvement recommendations. •Third: a detailed report describing what was done; features all the analyses, tables, and figures; interprets the findings; and offers the specific details about next steps. The detailed report is sent to chairs of departments, quality leaders, and senior administrators. Another avenue of communication to consider is quarterly or semiannual events/forums that include presentations and posters on recent quality, safety, or performance improvement projects. These events can be offered to a broad audience and widely publicized. Other options for disseminating quality, safety, and performance improvement findings to staff include monthly newsletters, e-mails, blogs, and other social media distribution networks. Myriad data analysis and graphic display tools are available to assist with understanding a process at a point in time and over time. Although no single tool can support an entire process improvement team, tools can be used in combination to facilitate making data-based decisions. However, the use of tools alone does not guarantee accurate and effective decision-making.

Section Summary A historical perspective and new developments in health data analytics puts into context the importance of information management in the work of the healthcare quality professional. The analysis of data and translation to meaningful information are critical given national quality and safety priorities and initiatives. Healthcare reform includes an emphasis on data and information related to individuals, populations, and organizations. Strategies are proposed to foster the use of data in decision-making. The public reporting of quality data promotes value-based purchasing—accountability for is part of the equation. Factoring into the equation are evidence-based quality management, measurement and decision support, systematic healthcare QI, and MISs. Finally, sound study design and analysis support the healthcare quality professional’s efforts to achieve performance excellence and sustain a culture of safety and quality. References 1.Juran JM.

The model is not meant to replace change models that organizations may already be using, but rather to accelerate improvement. This model has been used very successfully by hundreds of health care organizations in many countries to improve many different health care processes and outcomes. The model has two parts: Three fundamental questions, which can be addressed in any order. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle** to test changes in real work settings. The PDSA cycle guides the test of a change to determine if the change is an improvement. Forming the Team Including the right people on a process improvement team is critical to a successful improvement effort. Teams vary in size and composition. Each organization builds teams to suit its own needs. ModelforImprovement_v2.jpg Setting Aims The aim should be time-specific and measurable; it should also define the specific population of patients or other system that will be affected. Establishing Measures Teams use quantitative measures to determine if a specific change actually leads to an improvement. Selecting Changes Ideas for change may come from those who work in the system or from the experience of others who have successfully improved. Testing Changes The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle is shorthand for testing a change in the real work setting — by planning it, trying it, observing the results, and acting on what is learned. This is the scientific method adapted for action-oriented learning. Implementing Changes After testing a change on a small scale, learning from each test, and refining the change through several PDSA cycles, the team may implement the change on a broader scale — for example, for an entire pilot population or on an entire unit. Spreading Changes After successful implementation of a change or package of changes for a pilot population or an entire unit, the team can spread the changes to other parts of the organization or in other organizations.

Quality Progress. November 2010. Science of Improvement: Forming the Team Including the right people on an improvement team is critical to a successful improvement effort. Teams vary in size and composition. Each organization builds teams to suit its own needs. First, review the aim.Model for Improvement Second, consider the system that relates to that aim: What system will be affected by the improvement efforts? Third, be sure that the team includes members familiar with all the different parts of the process — managers and administrators as well as those who work in the process, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and front-line workers. Finally, each team needs an executive sponsor who takes responsibility for the success of the project. Examples of Effective Teams Effective teams include members representing three different kinds of expertise within the organization: system leadership, technical expertise, and day-to-day leadership. There may be one or more individuals on the team with each kind of expertise, or one individual may have expertise in more than one area, but all three areas should be represented in order to drive improvement successfully. Clinical Leader Teams need someone with enough authority in the organization to test and implement a change that has been suggested and to deal with issues that arise. The team's clinical leader understands both the clinical implications of proposed changes and the consequences such a change might trigger in other parts of the system. Technical Expertise A technical expert is someone who knows the subject intimately and who understands the processes of care. An expert on improvement methods can provide additional technical support by helping the team determine what to measure, assisting in design of simple, effective measurement tools, and providing guidance on collection, interpretation, and display of data. Day-to-Day Leadership A day-to-day leader is the driver of the project, assuring that tests are implemented and overseeing data collection. It is important that this person understands not only the details of the system, but also the various effects of making change(s) in the system. This person also needs to be able to work effectively with the physician champion(s).

The Sponsor is not a day-to-day participant in team meetings and testing, but should review the team's progress on a regular basis.

Science of Improvement: Setting Aims Model for Improvement: What are we trying to accomplish? Model for ImprovementImprovement requires setting aims. An organization will not improve without a clear and firm intention to do so. The aim should be time-specific and measurable; it should also define the specific population of patients that will be affected. Agreeing on the aim is crucial; so is allocating the people and resources necessary to accomplish the aim. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in Washington, DC, USA, released To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, a report that brought much public attention to the crisis of patient safety in the United States. In 2001, the IOM issued a second report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century, which outlines six overarching \"Aims for Improvement\" for health care: Safe: Avoid injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.

Science of Improvement: Establishing Measures ​Model for Improvement: How will we know that a change is an improvement? Measurement is a critical part of testing and implementing changes; measures tell a team whether the changes they are making actually lead to improvement. Measurement for improvement should not be confused with measurement for research. This difference is outlined in the table below. Measurement for Research Measurement for Learning and Process Improvement Purpose To discover new knowledge To bring new knowledge into daily practice Tests One large \"blind\" test Many sequential, observable tests Biases Control for as many biases as possible Stabilize the biases from test to test Data Gather as much data as possible, \"just in case\" Gather \"just enough\" data to learn and complete another cycle Duration Can take long periods of time to obtain results \"Small tests of significant changes\" accelerates the rate of improvement See also: Tips for Effective Measures. The Whole System Measures, a set of health system performance measures, keyed to the six dimensions of quality outlined by the Institute of Medicine in the Crossing the Quality Chasm report — safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable — that can be used to evaluate the overall performance of a health system. Three Types of Measures Use a balanced set of measures for all improvement efforts: outcomes measures, process measures, and balancing measures. Outcome Measures How does the system impact the values of patients, their health and wellbeing? What are impacts on other stakeholders such as payers, employees, or the community?

Are we on track in our efforts to improve the system? For diabetes: Percentage of patients whose hemoglobin A1c level was measured twice in the past year For access: Average daily clinician hours available for appointments For critical care: Percent of patients with intentional rounding completed on schedule. Balancing Measures (looking at a system from different directions/dimensions) Are changes designed to improve one part of the system causing new problems in other parts of the system? For reducing time patients spend on a ventilator after surgery: Make sure reintubation rates are not increasing For reducing patients' length of stay in the hospital: Make sure readmission rates are not increasing Sample Measures See the Measures section for sample measures. Using Sampling: An Example Here is how one team used sampling in measuring the time for transfer from Emergency Department (ED) to inpatient bed. Rapid movement from the Emergency Department (ED) after a decision to admit the patient is critical flow for entry to the entire system for emergent patient care. It represents the ability of patients with various illnesses to get into the system through the most common admission route. Sampling approach: The measurement will consist of 6 weekly data collections of 25 patients each. The patients can be sampled in several ways: 5 patients per day for 5 days of the week. The patients must be consecutive and at least one day must be a weekend day. or 25 consecutive patients regardless of any specific day, except that it must include some weekend admissions. or If there are fewer than 25 admissions for a week, the total admissions for the week should be included in the sample. The time is measured from the decision to admit to the physical appearance of the patient into the inpatient room. The destination cannot be a \"holding area\" but must be a \"real inpatient bed.\" The sample collection should be done in real time, so a data collection process needs to be worked out by members of the team to achieve this goal. The collections must be done weekly and summarized as the percentage of patients in the sample that achieved the goal for that week.

Six weeks of data needs to be collected and six data points placed on a run chart. Plotting Data Over Time Plotting data over time using a run chart is a simple and effective way to determine whether the changes you are making are leading to improvement. Annotate the run chart to show the changes you made. You can use the Improvement Tracker to automatically plot your data over time. Science of Improvement: Selecting Changes ​Model for Improvement: What change can we make that will result in improvement? While all changes do not lead to improvement, all improvement requires change. The ability to develop, test, and implement changes is essential for any individual, group, or organization that wants to continuously improve. There are many kinds of changes that will lead to improvement, but these specific changes are developed from a limited number of change concepts. A change concept is a general notion or approach to change that has been found to be useful in developing specific ideas for changes that lead to improvement. Creatively combining these change concepts with knowledge about specific subjects can help generate ideas for tests of change. After generating ideas, run Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to test a change or group of changes on a small scale to see if they result in improvement. If they do, expand the tests and gradually incorporate larger and larger samples until you are confident that the changes should be adopted more widely. The change concepts included here were developed by Associates in Process Improvement. See The Improvement Guide (Langley GJ, Nolan KM, Nolan TW, Norman CL, Provost LP. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, Inc.; 2009) for a list of hundreds of change concepts, as well as examples of how they were applied in process improvement, both inside and outside of health care. Examples of Change Concepts For more detailed information on specific change concepts, see Using Change Concepts for Improvement and the Changes section.

Improve Work Flow Improving the flow of work in processes is an important way to improve the quality of the goods and services produced by those processes. Optimize Inventory Inventory of all types is a possible source of waste in organizations; understanding where inventory is stored in a system is the first step in finding opportunities for improvement. Change the Work Environment Changing the work environment itself can be a high-leverage opportunity for making all other process changes more effective. Producer/Customer Interface To benefit from improvements in quality of products and services, the customer must recognize and appreciate the improvements. Manage Time An organization can gain a competitive advantage by reducing the time to develop new products, waiting times for services, lead times for orders and deliveries, and cycle times for all functions in the organization. Focus on Variation Reducing variation improves the predictability of outcomes and helps reduce the frequency of poor results. Error Proofing Organizations can reduce errors by redesigning the system to make it less likely for people in the system to make errors. One way to error proof a system is to make the information necessary to perform a task available in the external world, and not just in one's memory, by writing it down or by actually making it inherent in the product or process. Focus on the Product or Service Although many organizations focus on ways to improve processes, it is also important to address improvement of products and services. Science of Improvement: Testing Changes Model for Improvement: Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) Cycles ​Model for ImprovementOnce a team has set an aim, established its membership, and developed measures to determine whether a change leads to an improvement, the next step is to test a change in the real work setting. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle is shorthand for testing a change — by planning it, trying it, observing the results, and acting on what is learned. This is the scientific method, used for action-oriented learning. See also: Tips for Testing Changes, Linking Tests of Change, Testing Multiple Changes, Implementing Changes, Spreading Changes. Reasons to Test Changes To increase your belief that the change will result in improvement. To decide which of several proposed changes will lead to the desired improvement.

To evaluate costs, social impact, and side effects from a proposed change. To minimize resistance upon implementation. Steps in the PDSA Cycle Step 1: Plan Plan the test or observation, including a plan for collecting data. State the objective of the test. Make predictions about what will happen and why. Develop a plan to test the change. (Who? What? When? Where? What data need to be collected?) Step 2: Do Try out the test on a small scale. Carry out the test. Document problems and unexpected observations. Begin analysis of the data. Step 3: Study Set aside time to analyze the data and study the results. Complete the analysis of the data. Compare the data to your predictions. Summarize and reflect on what was learned. Step 4: Act Refine the change, based on what was learned from the test. Determine what modifications should be made. Prepare a plan for the next test. Example of a Test of Change (Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycle) Depending on their aim, teams choose promising changes and use Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to test a change quickly on a small scale, see how it works, and refine the change as necessary before implementing it on a broader scale. The following example shows how a team started with a small-scale test. Diabetes: Planned visits for blood sugar management. Plan: Ask one patient if he or she would like more information on how to manage his or her blood sugar. Do: Dr. J. asked his first patient with diabetes on Tuesday. Study: Patient was interested; Dr. J. was pleased at the positive response. Act: Dr. J. will continue with the next five patients and set up a planned visit for those who say yes.

Implementation is a permanent change to the way work is done and, as such, involves building the change into the organization. It may affect documentation, written policies, hiring, training, compensation, and aspects of the organization's infrastructure that are not heavily engaged in the testing phase. Implementation also requires the use of the PDSA cycle. See also: Testing Changes, Tips for Testing Changes, Linking Tests of Change, Testing Multiple Changes, Implementing Changes, Spreading Changes. Example Testing a change: Three nurses on different shifts use a new medication reconciliation and order form. Implementing a change: All 30 nurses on the pilot unit begin using the new medication reconciliation and order form. Science of Improvement: Spreading Changes Spread is the process of taking a successful implementation process from a pilot unit or pilot population and replicating that change or package of changes in other parts of the organization or other organizations.Model for Improvement During implementation, teams learn valuable lessons necessary for successful spread, including key infrastructure issues, optimal sequencing of tasks, and working with people to help them adopt and adapt a change. Spread efforts will benefit from the use of the PDSA cycle. Units adopting the change need to plan how best to adapt the change to their unit and to determine if the change resulted in the predicted improvement. Example If all 30 nurses on a pilot unit successfully implement a new medication reconciliation and order form, then spread would be replicating this change in all nursing units in the organization and assisting the units in adopting or adapting the change.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI - How to Improve.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI - How to Improve","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI - How to Improve_10"}}],["416",{"pageContent":"The Triple Aim was the brainchild of two of our faculty John Whittington and Tom Nolan who came up with in about 2006 I remember them coming in with the idea and it was a real breakthrough so the goal they had in mind was to articulate in a very efficient way the aims of healthcare up until that time the answer would have been probably the best answer would have been referenced to the Institute of Medicine report crossing the quality chasm which had laid out six dimensions of quali six dimensions of need they call them aims for improvement and those most people in the field now know them their safety effectiveness patient-centeredness timeliness efficiency and equity everyone up until that point was oh well that's well that's what the social need is six aims and Whittington and no one said not wait a minute that's about if you need the care so if you need the care absolutely it's those those properties should be there and you're when you care for your heart attack your broken arm your depression or you get your checkup in the experi the individual experience of care but they said there's actually a second component of aim and they call that the health of the population because why do you have your heart attack why why did you break your arm why why are you depressed and the causes they don't lie in healthcare the cause of illness isn't the absence of health care health care is a repair shop so they said that society also needs us to keep you help you stay what healthy and the third aim they added which I think was particularly brilliant is while reducing per capita cost and that is because the the needs of the society that the people we serve go beyond healthcare they've got other things to do with the resources they may want to go to the movies tonight or you know a corporation maybe you want to be more competitive and pay its workers more and government may need to put money into roads or schools so they posited this collection is the system of aims better care for individuals that are health for populations and lower per capita cost as the as is a complete statement as they possibly could of the social need we're here to fill it's like a compass direction that tells us what success is and that became known as the the Triple Aim","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI - Institute for Healthcare Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI - Institute for Healthcare Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI - Institute for Healthcare Improvement_0"}}],["417",{"pageContent":"Quality Improvement Project Management Managing a quality improvement project is a critical skill for anyone interested in making care delivery — and systems of care — better in their health care organization.

Dedicated and thoughtful planning time at the beginning of a project is more likely to lead to a successful project. • Block time on your calendar to manage the upfront volume of work. • Set up meetings with the team and the improvement project sponsor with greater frequency in the first few weeks and less frequency over time. • Hold a project kickoff event to study the process and define the aim, measures, and change ideas: a full-day kaizen event, process mapping session, or team retreat. • Meet with your improvement project sponsor to ensure you agree on the project scope, aim, constraints, and how you’ll work together. • Use a checklist of tasks to show the team progress before you start testing. • Create a set-up phase that is time-limited (e.g., 30 days) to ensure the team does not get stuck in the planning phase. • Set a date to pause the project if the set-up activities are not completed.

The most effective improvement teams leverage various resources and organize the work to make the most of the human assets in the organization. Team leaders should focus on building their core team and then keep them engaged throughout the improvement project. • Ensure that the right people are on the team. If you can’t recruit a key stakeholder (especially someone who might stop the improvement work), consider the following: o Change the project scope to be within the control of those who can be on the team. o Identify “consultants” to provide regular guidance to the team. o Use your improvement project sponsor to gather support for the team. • Invite improvement team members to lead specific change ideas and Plan-DoStudy-Act (PDSA) testing cycles, or measures and data collection and analysis. • Engage your improvement project sponsor to help push the team beyond the status quo, scope the project to the timeframe, and think through the improvement project aim, change ideas, tests, and measures. • To move more quickly, determine with the sponsor up front how and by whom decisions will be made. • Engage “historians” early to learn from past efforts and help the team make predictions about whether something will work based on their past learning. Confirm or change the predictions based on results of tests.

You can, however, plan out your progress toward the aim (e.g., when you will be testing, when you will be implementing, when you will be 50% to goal). o Build in points for reflection and celebration (learn from both successes and failures). • Look for opportunities to pick up the pace.

For example, if you are collecting data monthly, can you instead do it weekly or even daily? Meet more frequently for less time using huddles. • Frequent improvement team huddles and the use of visuals (e.g., run charts, flowcharts, visual management boards) help the team keep pace and communicate about the project work. • Be intentional with time, always asking whether you are spending time in the right way in service of your goal: o Start meetings by reviewing the aim and predict how each PDSA cycle will contribute to the larger goal. If you think the contribution will be minimal, consider spending your time elsewhere. o Make sure you’re spending more time on improvement than measurement or paperwork. • When you reach the end date of the improvement project, purposefully decide to continue (setting a new end date and/or creating a new project charter) or to conclude (because you achieved your goal or because it’s not the right time for the work). Take time to appreciate everyone’s contributions and celebrate what was learned. • If you conclude it’s not the right time for the work, document what you learned and share it with teams that might continue the work at another time.

The tips and tools shared here aspire to make improvement work easy, efficient, meaningful, and fun (especially meetings!) for the team. Additionally, at the beginning of an improvement project, focus on learning quickly so that you can make progress faster. This includes keeping your aim, measures, and changes flexible; trying to scale‐down tests and data collection; and ensuring that the project work is designed to help the team understand what it takes to bring about improvement that is not focused on research or accountability. • Keep improvement team meetings short by using a standard agenda that runs through key points. • Use existing meetings, structures, and one-to-one check-ins to do improvement work, including data collection.

Try starting meetings by asking each person to share one good thing. • Develop a theory of improvement (e.g., create a driver diagram). An incorrect theory gives the team more learning than having no theory at all. Refer back to your theory regularly; as you learn, the theory should change, as should your work and effort to align with the modified theory. • Predict the percentage each driver contributes to your theory (e.g., driver 1 will have a 20% impact, driver 2 a 50% impact, etc.); revise these predictions as you test and learn to track the contribution of various efforts toward achieving your improvement aim. • Remain curious and willing to be surprised and to change your efforts as you learn. • Do everything “in pencil” to encourage change based on learning throughout the project: use flipcharts, sticky notes, and whiteboards instead of lamination or slides. People are more likely to be open to ideas and give feedback when the “product” doesn’t feel final. • “Step-down” to learn quickly. Look for opportunities to accelerate learning with small tests (e.g., testing with one person this afternoon instead of 20 people next week). • Collect data that’s “good enough” to drive improvement, not “exquisitely precise” or “official” data that costs a lot and delays your need to test and act. Use sampling to avoid survey fatigue and accelerate learning (e.g., send 10 different staff members a three-question survey every week rather than all 40 staff members a survey every month).

Share stories of “hard-won” lessons that you don’t want them to have to learn themselves, in addition to successes. • If you achieved your improvement aim by the defined end date, set up a 30-, 60-, and 90-day plan to close out the project work. Decide which measures you will continue to track over time at some frequency to monitor that the gains made during the improvement effort are sustained.

That was the reaction a friend of mine had when I suggested a couple of years ago that she add that to the strategic goals she was exploring with her team on a day-long management retreat. She did try, and her report back to me was this: “They hated it. They said, ‘Get real! That’s not possible.’” Sad to say, I suspect that may still be the response of all too many workgroups and leaders, both inside and outside health care. “Hunkering down,” “getting through the day,” “riding out the storm” — these are much more familiar attitudes in inevitably stressed work environments, as truly good people try hard to cope with systems that don’t serve them well, facing demands they can, at best, barely meet. The closest most organizations come to “joy” is “TGIF” parties — “Thank goodness it’s Friday. I made it through another week.” It has long seemed a paradox to me that such depletion of joy in work can pervade as noble and meaningful an enterprise as health care. What we in the healing professions and its support roles get to do every day touches the highest aspirations of a compassionate civilization. We have chosen a calling that invites people who are worried and suffering to share their stories and allow us to help. If any work ought to give spiritual satisfaction to the workers, this is it. “Joy,” not “burnout,” ought to rule the day. In our work in health care, joy is not just humane; it’s instrumental. As my colleague Maureen Bisognano has reminded us, “You cannot give what you do not have.” The gifts of hope, confidence, and safety that health care should offer patients and families can only come from a workforce that feels hopeful, confident, and safe. Joy in work is an essential resource for the enterprise of healing. Good news! Joy is possible. We know it is possible, not only from intuition, but also from science. This IHI White Paper summarizes a surprisingly large literature on theory and evidence about factors, such as management behaviors, system designs, communication patterns, operating values, and technical supports, that seem associated with better or worse morale, burnout, and satisfaction in work.

Berwick, MD President Emeritus and Senior Fellow Institute for Healthcare Improvement WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 5 Executive Summary With increasing demands on time, resources, and energy, in addition to poorly designed systems of daily work, it’s not surprising health care professionals are experiencing burnout at increasingly higher rates, with staff turnover rates also on the rise. Yet, joy in work is more than just the absence of burnout or an issue of individual wellness; it is a system property. It is generated (or not) by the system and occurs (or not) organization-wide. Joy in work — or lack thereof — not only impacts individual staff engagement and satisfaction, but also patient experience, quality of care, patient safety, and organizational performance. This white paper is intended to serve as a guide for health care organizations to engage in a participative process where leaders ask colleagues at all levels of the organization, “What matters to you?” — enabling them to better understand the barriers to joy in work, and co-create meaningful, high-leverage strategies to address these issues.

Introduction If burnout in health care were described in clinical or public health terms, it might well be called an epidemic. The numbers are alarming. A 2015 study found over 50 percent of physicians report symptoms of burnout.1 Thirty-three percent of new registered nurses seek another job within a year, according to another 2013 report.2 Turnover is up, and morale is down. Burnout affects all aspects of the pursuit of better health and health care. It leads to lower levels of staff engagement, which correlate with lower customer (patient) experience, lower productivity, and an increased risk of workplace accidents. These all significantly affect the financial vitality of an organization. The impact on patient care is even more worrying. Lower levels of staff engagement are linked with lower-quality patient care, including safety, and burnout limits providers’ empathy — a crucial component of effective and person-centered care. So, what can leaders do to counteract this epidemic? The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) believes an important part of the solution is to focus on restoring joy to the health care workforce. With this in mind, IHI developed four steps leaders can take to improve joy in work (the “how”); and the IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work — critical components of a system for ensuring a joyful, engaged workforce (the “what”). Together, they serve as a guide for health care organizations, teams, and individuals to improve joy in work of all colleagues.

Why Use the Term “Joy in Work”? Why “joy in work”? And why now? Some may think focusing on joy in health care — a physically, intellectually, and emotionally demanding profession — is a distant goal. But focusing on joy is important for three fundamental reasons. First, focusing on joy, as opposed to focusing only on burnout or low levels of staff engagement, accords with an approach applied to solving many intractable problems in heath and health care. It’s tempting to analyze a problem by only paying attention to deficits or gaps. But to get to solutions, it is essential to identify, understand, and leverage all the assets that can be brought to bear, and joy is one of health care’s greatest assets. Health care is one of the few professions that regularly provides the opportunity for its workforce to profoundly improve lives. Caring and healing should be naturally joyful activities. The compassion and dedication of health care staff are key assets that, if nurtured and not impeded, can lead to joy as well as to effective and empathetic care. This assets-based approach to improvement enables people to look at issues from different perspectives, which often leads to designing more innovative solutions. The sociologist Aaron Antonovksy taught us to think of health as more than merely the absence of disease. Health is about coherence, he said — a sense that life is comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful.3 Following Antonovsky’s lead, the second reason to focus on joy in work is because joy is about more than the absence of burnout. Joy, like Antonovsky’s conception of health, is about connections to meaning and purpose.

Joy, like Antonovsky’s conception of health, is about connections to meaning and purpose. By focusing on joy through this lens, health care leaders can reduce burnout while simultaneously building the resilience health care workers rely on each day. Again, the goal is to design innovative solutions by looking at issues from a different perspective. The third reason for focusing on joy takes us back to W. Edwards Deming. His 14 Points for Management, first presented in his book Out of the Crisis, address joy, but use different terms. Consider, for example, Point 11, “Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship,” and Point 12, “Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship.” For Deming, “pride of workmanship” and “joy” were highly related, if not interchangeable.4 Later in life, Deming increasingly emphasized the importance of joy in work. In his final lectures, he routinely stated that “Management’s overall aim should be to create a system in which everybody may take joy in [their] work.” Ensuring joy is a crucial component of the “psychology of change,” one of the cornerstones of Deming’s scientific approach to improvement. In addition to being a core part of his theory of improvement, joy in work, to Deming, was also a fundamental right. It is up to leaders, he argued, to ensure that workers can enjoy that right. WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 7 Fairness and Equity as Contributors to Joy in Work Individuals who experience unfairness and inequity at work, or even outside of work, feel disempowered and will likely disengage, regardless of the basis for the inequity. Links have been made between race and ethnicity and wellbeing, showing various racial and ethnic groups experiencing less joy in work.

They went further to show that the sites with the highest rates of discrimination against minorities had the lowest patient experience scores. Besides indicating toxic environments for individuals and teams, addressing racism and inequity in the workplace becomes a quality-of-care imperative.5 Focusing on equity can also lead to improving joy in work. For example, Henry Ford Health System’s emphasis on health care equity has been a driver of employee engagement. They administered a Gallup Employee Engagement survey and found that employees involved in health care equity work were seven times more engaged than other employees. The IHI White Paper, Achieving Health Equity: A Guide for Health Care Organizations, offers a framework for health care organizations to improve health equity for their staff and the communities they serve. 6 Regardless of the approach taken, health care organizations need the full engagement of all staff members in the mission. If individuals disengage, group output becomes less diverse, opinions are marginalized, decisions and performance suffer, and consequently, patients suffer.7 When everyone is engaged in an equitable and diverse environment, they feel as though they can listen to what matters to patients and colleagues; comfortably ask questions, request help, or challenge what’s happening; and use teamwork to successfully solve challenges. All of these contribute to a positive work experience and enable the entire team to experience joy in work. The Case for Improving Joy in Work Perhaps the best case for improving joy is that it incorporates the most essential aspects of positive daily work life. A focus on joy is a step toward creating safe, humane places for people to find meaning and purpose in their work. There is also a strong business case for improving joy in work. Recognizing that joy does not yet have a single validated measure, which we’ll discuss more in the measurement section, the business case draws on outcomes of the work environment, including engagement, satisfaction, patient experience, burnout, and turnover rates. Engagement is an imprecise but often-used proxy measure for joy. An engaged workforce is one that holds a positive attitude toward the organization and its values, and is foundational to creating high-performing organizations.8 When researchers studied human capital management drivers, they found that traditional Human Resources metrics (e.g., average time to fill open positions and total hours of training provided) do not predict organizational performance.

Rather, a score of human capital drivers including employee engagement, among other factors, was more relevant.9 A UK study also demonstrated the relationship of performance and profitability with employee engagement.10 These and other studies confirm the intuitive: improving engagement contributes to improved performance.11 It enables greater professional productivity with lower turnover rates. Joy in work, in turn, improves patient experience, outcomes, and safety, resulting in substantially lower costs.12 WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 8 Many have documented this correlation between greater employee satisfaction and safer, more efficient patient care.13 There is ample evidence that management practices to produce a joyful, engaged workforce are associated with fewer medical errors and better patient experience; 14 less waste; higher employee productivity;15 and more discretionary effort on the part of staff and reduced turnover, leading to better financial performance.16 Studies have also shown a link between job dissatisfaction and plans for leaving a job. By considering employee turnover as a factor that’s associated with joy in work, it is possible to make an explicit financial case as well. One study showed that lost revenue for replacing one full-time equivalent (FTE) physician is $990,034, plus recruitment costs of $61,200 and annual start-up costs of $211,063. That means replacing one departing physician and on-boarding a new physician will cost the organization more than $1 million ($1,262,297).17 Finally, measuring joy and sharing the measurement results externally helps attract and retain top performers to an organization.18 Four Steps for Leaders As IHI engaged with partners in thinking about how to restore, foster, and nurture joy in the health care workforce, it became evident that leaders often find it challenging to see a way to move from the current state to “joy in work.” Here are four steps leaders can take to find a path forward. Figure 1. Four Steps for Leaders Figure 1 depicts the steps as stairs, to illustrate that each step serves as the foundation for the steps that follow. First, leaders engage colleagues to identify what matters to them in their work (Step 1). Next, leaders identify the processes, issues, or circumstances that are impediments to what matters — the “pebbles in their shoes” that get in the way of meeting professional, social, and psychological needs (Step","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work_8"}}],["431",{"pageContent":"(Step 1). Next, leaders identify the processes, issues, or circumstances that are impediments to what matters — the “pebbles in their shoes” that get in the way of meeting professional, social, and psychological needs (Step 2). 19 Then, in partnership, multidisciplinary teams come together and share responsibility for removing these impediments (focusing on nine critical components), and for improving and sustaining joy (Step 3). Leaders and staff use improvement science together to accelerate improvement and create a more joyful and productive place to work (Step 4). The four steps do not ignore the larger organizational issues, or “boulders,” that exist, such as the impact of electronic health record functionality on clinicians’ daily work, or workload and staffing issues. Rather, the steps empower local teams to identify and address impediments they can WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 9 change, while larger system-wide issues that affect joy in work are also being prioritized and addressed by senior leaders. This process converts the conversation from “If only they would…” to “What can we do today?” It helps everyone see the organization as “us” and not “them.” Creating joy and engagement in the workplace is a key role of effective leaders. IHI’s High-Impact Leadership Framework describes leaders’ actions that make them effective, from being an authentic presence at the front line to staying focused on mission and what matters, and identifies attention to joy in work as a major component of the leadership role.20 These leadership actions also give meaning to work, promote camaraderie, and are essential to improving joy. Similarly, everything we know about improving safety in health care relies on ensuring a fair and just culture, effective teams, and daily improvement — those things that also contribute to joy in work.21 Safety, effective leadership, and a joyful workforce are inextricably linked. Get Ready Before launching into Step 1, three “Get Ready” actions will establish a foundation for success. To embark on the steps without making these preparations risks derailing well-intentioned plans.  Prepare for the “What matters to you?” conversations: These are rich, learning conversations — not intended to communicate information, but rather to listen and learn. Leaders are often ill equipped to have effective conversations with colleagues, and many put off these important dialogues because of two primary concerns: 1) What","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work_9"}}],["432",{"pageContent":"These are rich, learning conversations — not intended to communicate information, but rather to listen and learn. Leaders are often ill equipped to have effective conversations with colleagues, and many put off these important dialogues because of two primary concerns: 1) What if colleagues ask for things I can’t do? and 2) How am I going to fix all the things they identify? Leaders rightly fear an avalanche of issues falling on them that they are unable to address effectively. Leaders and colleagues should recognize this is a different approach than the usual “I tell you what isn’t working and you fix it” approach. See Appendix A for a guide to conducting effective “What matters to you?” conversations and resolving issues that arise from such conversations. The guide helps leaders get started quickly and learn as they go.  Ensure leader capacity at all levels of the organization: Leaders at the local level (e.g., program, department, or clinic) — referred to as “core leaders” in this paper — are tasked with guiding the work to improve joy in work in their respective areas. These leaders need the capacity (i.e., time to do the work and improvement science skills) and skill to facilitate the “What matters?” conversations, and to act on the issues that surface. Identifying impediments and then not acting on them intensifies rather than diminishes cynicism. For example, one organization testing these steps asked staff about impediments, but was unable to act at that time. A year later, when leaders returned to colleagues to ask about “What matters?” they were met with frustration — staff were hesitant to participate further because nothing had happened after their previous input. During prototype testing, sites found that they could begin tests of change on some local impediments almost immediately, especially if they broke these down into smaller segments. Sites that made progress on reaching their aims designated skilled and committed core leaders who facilitated improvement immediately, rather than waiting for an external resource team.  Designate a senior leader champion: Optimally, joy in work is an organization-wide strategy, led by senior leaders and involving colleagues and leaders at all levels. Core leaders need to have at least one senior leader as a champion when issues arise that go beyond the scope of their local leadership. The champion also takes on the “boulders” that are too big for a local unit, and begins to address them in the larger organization.

WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 10 Step 1. Ask staff, “What matters to you?” This step is about asking the right questions and really listening to the answers to identify what contributes to — or detracts from — joy in work for staff (see Appendix A for a “What Matters to You?” Conversation Guide). 22 For many years, IHI has been promoting the transformative provocation to ask patients, “What matters to you?” in addition to “What’s the matter?”23 Health care leaders need to ask the health care workforce the same question. Only by understanding what truly matters to staff will senior management be able to identify and remove barriers to joy. During the IHI prototype testing, some sites found it helpful to start with identifying a senior leader champion who commits to making joy in work a shared responsibility at all levels (Step 3). Highlighting senior leader support enabled staff to feel more comfortable bringing up issues and being honest about what matters to them. At these sites, teams needed assurance that change was an option before they were willing to share. Whether or not a champion is identified at the outset, leaders can support the process and show a genuine interest in the wellbeing of individuals and teams by regularly engaging colleagues in discussions to identify the unique local and organizational opportunities to improve joy in work. 24 Discovering what matters relies heavily on trusting relationships and assumes that leaders know how to listen. This is not always the case. Strong leaders use effective listening and communication skills to involve others, build consensus, and influence decisions. Teams have found success with using communication boards, surveys, regular staff meetings or more informal meetings to engage, inform, and listen. Identifying what matters need not take a lot of time. However, what works in one setting may not work in another. It’s up to leaders to find the method that works best for their colleagues and fits into the daily or weekly workflow. By beginning with asking “What matters?” leaders engage in a form of appreciative inquiry that taps into strengths or bright spots, or what’s already working in the organization, that offer energy for change. Conversation questions may include:  What makes for a good day for you?  What makes you proud to work here? �","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work_11"}}],["434",{"pageContent":"that taps into strengths or bright spots, or what’s already working in the organization, that offer energy for change. Conversation questions may include:  What makes for a good day for you?  What makes you proud to work here?  When we are at our best, what does that look like? This then sets the context for asking what gets in the way of a good day or what makes for a bad day. When leaders and team members are frank about what makes for a bad day, whether it is an overload of patients in a clinic or an inability to act on patients’ wishes for care, leaders and colleagues share the problems and ultimately the solutions. This creates a sense of “we are in this together.” While leaders may not take immediate action on all issues, the conversation establishes a place to start to make the work environment and patient care better. Through this process, leaders can begin to identify assets and bright spots on which to build, as well as defects in the system that might be improved. By cultivating leaders’ ability to work collaboratively, facilitate change, build relationships, and employ a participative management style, the organization will be in a better position to tackle complex challenges.25 During the Innovation Projects, IHI interviewed a few organizations outside of health care that have done this well. Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks Coffee Company, shared that listening and ensuring people feel heard has been the cornerstone of their work. “Leaders can’t always do something to improve the problem, but they can listen and try,” Behar said. “The tension WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 11 goes away as soon as people feel like their feedback is valued.” One way Starbucks did this was through “Mission Review” cards. Every employee was given a postcard-sized card and encouraged to report any decision that did not, in their opinion, support the company’s mission statement to a “Mission Review” team. Employees received a response from leadership within two weeks. Step 2. Identify unique impediments to joy in work in the local context Steps 1 and 2 usually happen in the same conversation and continue over time. Having conversations about what really matters to each person builds the trust needed to identify frustrations they experience during the work day.

Everyone must feel like their ideas, opinions, and comments will be listened to before they can be open and honest. Just as answers to the question, “What matters to you?” will vary depending on the individual, the system-level impediments to joy in work will also vary depending on the organization, department, program, clinic, or team. Responses to this question, in combination with other real-time data collection and surveys (explained in the measurement section), enable leaders to build a comprehensive understanding of what contributes to joy in work in the organization, as well as what doesn’t. In Step 2, identifying unique local impediments to joy in work is how leaders can begin to address the psychological needs of humans. By building on the “What matters?” conversations, leaders work with colleagues to identify impediments that exist in daily work — the “pebbles in their shoes” — and then set priorities and address them together. This offers everyone a chance to give input on which impediments to address, build camaraderie by working together to remove impediments, and practice equity in respecting all voices. IHI’s work with the organizations involved in prototype testing offers the following examples of identifying local impediments:  The University of Michigan Cardiac Intensive Care Unit aimed to engage members of their community in a discussion around joy in work, discover what matters to their team, and identify two to three areas in which to test small changes. To do this, they asked staff about what matters to them and what gets in the way of experiencing joy in work. They then asked small groups of nursing staff, cardiology fellows, and “scribes” to use check marks to indicate “echoed” comments to identify top priorities. This process provided everyone a chance to see the issues identified and to weigh in on what to tackle first.  Many organizations involved in the prototype testing created regular huddles, workgroups, or team meetings as forums for members to share “bright spots” and identify impediments to joy in work. Huddles were used to ask colleagues to share what a good day at work looks like for them; what makes for a bad day; and what they appreciate or are grateful for. One site described this as a pause for a “joyful moment.”  All organizations had some mechanism for making the identified impediments visible, such as a “What Matters","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work_13"}}],["436",{"pageContent":"makes for a bad day; and what they appreciate or are grateful for. One site described this as a pause for a “joyful moment.”  All organizations had some mechanism for making the identified impediments visible, such as a “What Matters to You?” or other type of communication board. For example, many sites posted sticky notes that resulted from conversations in meetings or huddles on a display in a team area, with an opportunity to contribute additional impediments or improvement ideas to the list. Making the impediments and associated ideas for improvement visible adds to the collective sense that “we are in this together.” WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 12 One area that prototype sites identified as a challenge in Step 2 is how to respectfully handle the negative team members — those who complain, but don’t participate in identifying solutions. Most leaders were pleased to discover that by initiating the “What matters?” conversation with colleagues first, spending time truly listening — rather than defending or saying why something will not work, clarifying what they heard, and adding the impediments identified to the suggestions list or notes — led to positive engagement. Emphasizing a focus on what staff can do together to address the impediments using improvement science methods and tools was vital for these teams. This led to previously negative members joining in as they developed hope that irritants in daily life would be addressed. Step 3. Commit to a systems approach to making joy in work a shared responsibility at all levels of the organization Making a workplace joyful is the job of leaders. Nevertheless, everyone from senior executive leaders to clinical and administrative staff has a role to play. From creating effective systems to building teams to bolstering one’s own resilience and supporting a positive culture, each person contributes. According to most sites engaged in the IHI prototype testing, it is critical for leaders at all levels to dedicate time, attention, skill development, and necessary resources to improving joy in work. Leaders from the American Association of Critical Care Nurses shared that it is vital to have a constant champion dedicated to joy in work to ensure momentum and sustainability. Improving joy in work is directly linked to the skills of leaders at all levels. Organizations cannot just delegate responsibility for joy in work to the Human Resources department; it is everyone’s job.

Organizations cannot just delegate responsibility for joy in work to the Human Resources department; it is everyone’s job. In Step 3, it is most important to note that although there is a shared responsibility, not everyone does everything. The IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work (see Figure 2) shows nine core components that contribute to a happy, healthy, productive workforce. (Each of these components is discussed in detail later in the paper.) In addition, the three outer rings of the framework show who is responsible for these components: senior leaders are responsible for all nine components; managers and core leaders are responsible for five components; and individuals, for three components. The responsibilities depicted in Figure 2 are meant to help leaders assess and plan for ongoing development of behaviors and systems at all levels to improve and sustain joy in work. Certain barriers to joy need to be addressed before others and it’s critical to recognize some basic psychological preconditions for joy in work. With Maslow’s hierarchy of needs in mind, we identified that five fundamental human needs must be met to improve joy in work. 26 These five needs play a central role in the IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work (see Figure 2): physical and psychological safety; meaning and purpose; choice and autonomy; camaraderie and teamwork; and fairness and equity. The first four fundamental needs are discussed in more detail below. Fairness and equity were previously addressed at the beginning of the paper and contribute to each of the core components. While all five of these human needs will not be resolved before addressing local impediments to joy in work, actions and a commitment to addressing all five will ensure lasting results.

Use improvement science to test approaches to improving joy in work in your organization There are many ways to take a systems approach to improving joy in work. The aim is to make the change process rewarding and effective. Using principles of improvement science, organizations can determine if the changes they test are leading to improvement; if they are effective in different programs, departments, and clinics; and if they are sustainable.

In IHI’s prototype initiative, teams used the Model for Improvement27 or another improvement method that was standard in their organization. In all cases, the teams set an aim for their work, decided on measures that would tell them if they were making progress, and selected components of the Framework for Improving Joy in Work as areas in which to test changes. For example, one IHI prototype initiative team’s inpatient unit had the aim to improve staff engagement scores by 50 percent overall. By noting concerns in several units regarding safety and poorly coordinated care, and reviewing the components in the Framework for Improving Joy in Work, the team decided to focus on improving teamwork as a good way to raise staff engagement. Daily huddles had been successful in critical care areas, so the manager and some of the staff decided to test change-of-shift huddles as a standard practice on the inpatient unit as a way to improve teamwork and engagement. The team’s tests of changes included the following:  Aim: Increase staff engagement scores on the inpatient unit by 50 percent by December.  Measures: o Percent of shifts for which all teams had a daily huddle o Percent of staff that report they feel like a productive member of a team WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 14  Changes: The changes included finding a time that worked for daily huddles for each shift, building a standard agenda that could be completed in 10 minutes, and specifying who on the unit could lead the huddles.  Testing Changes: At this site, the team ran multiple tests on one unit the first week: 1. Have one 15-minute huddle, with one team on the day shift, focusing on all patients. In response to what the team learned from this first test, the staff on the unit ran multiple subsequent tests: - Change the huddle agenda to focus only on high-risk patients. - The charge nurse runs the huddle. - Have the huddle immediately after bedside report. - Huddle at a different time for the evening shift. By tracking the percent of shifts with a huddle and percent of staff that report feeling like a productive member of the team, the leaders had a sense of whether or not daily huddles were contributing to improved teamwork and engagement.

The team changed the measure from focusing on “feeling like a productive member of a team” to percent of staff responding “Agree” or “Strongly Agree” to the statement, “I have the tools and resources I need to do my job.” 2. Once this first team had a process that worked for both the day and evening shifts, the charge nurse established tests for the three other teams on the unit. Each team created their own tests to refine the daily huddle for their needs, including the timing that would allow staff to cover all patients. By the end of four months, 90 percent of teams on the unit were conducting daily huddles. The evening shift was an outlier, so the teams decided to keep working on shift huddles over time. Engagement scores rose by 30 percent as a result. 3. At this point, the leaders were ready to spread daily shift huddles to other units. Each unit had its own structures and routines, so the shift huddles had to be adapted in each unit location, again using a methodology to test changes and measure the results. Leaders also noted that feeling a part of a team and having the tools needed to do the work were not sufficient for raising engagement by 50 percent, and so began working on other changes related to the framework components for camaraderie and daily improvement. This example highlights key elements of improvement science:  Make sure the aim is clear and numerical (how much, by when).  Start small and use data to refine successive tests.  Make sure the change idea works before getting more people involved or spreading the change. With confidence that the change works, then try it in many different situations.  Track results of every test, using process measures first and then ultimately outcome measures; share results openly and help team members understand and use the data.  Improvement is participative and involves everyone, from senior leaders who set the organization’s strategic aim and support improvement, to core leaders who drive improvement every day, to the individuals who identify problems, seek and test solutions, and track the results.

WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 15 Appendix B provides examples of suggested changes for organizations to test for each of the nine critical components of the Framework for Improving Joy in Work. Of the nine components, prototype organizations frequently cited camaraderie and teamwork as the most critical to their progress in the initial stages of their work. The following are a few highlights from the IHI prototype testing that can serve as a model for Step 4.  The University of Virginia School of Nursing team found that using concepts from the IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work was more effective than the standard committeedriven process. In previous surveys, employees identified a strong desire for time off, unencumbered by the expectation of responding to email. With a small group of staff, the team tested a small change: stop sending email to staff during their time off. The benefits were immediately evident, so they expanded the change to all School of Nursing employees with great success. In a follow-up survey after the change was implemented, 80 percent of respondents reported improvement in respect for their personal time off. Building on this success, the team is using the IHI framework to address other longstanding problems that affect staff joy in work.  The Mount Auburn Hospital team used small tests of change to restructure their approach to engaging colleagues in efforts to improve joy in work and address issues identified by staff. They focused on re-establishing trust among staff to ensure them that concerns they raised would be addressed. Following each “What matters?” conversation, local core leaders posted the issues identified during these discussions on a board where they were visible to all staff. Then, as each concern was addressed with small tests of change, core leaders documented what was being done along with the resolution, including issues that had to be escalated to a higher level of leadership. Making small, visible changes on local issues, and being transparent about the work, alleviated staff concerns that their voices weren’t being heard and made the work environment more positive.

Figure 3. IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work As mentioned, four of the nine critical components for improving joy in work — physical and psychological safety, meaning and purpose, choice and autonomy, and camaraderie and teamwork — are fundamental human needs that require the greatest attention, perhaps first. For this reason, these four components, particularly physical and psychological safety, are elaborated on in more detail than the other components in this section. Fairness and equity, discussed earlier as the fifth fundamental human need, contributes to achieving success in all critical components. Physical and Psychological Safety  Physical Safety – People feel free from physical harm during daily work. WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 17  Psychological Safety – People feel secure and capable of changing;28 there are respectful interactions among all; people feel able to question, seek feedback, admit mistakes, and propose ideas; and the organization provides full support for the staff involved in an adverse event (often referred to as the second victim). 29 We define “physical safety” as feeling free from physical harm at work. Health care workers, particularly nurses, have very high rates of acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries, high exposures to blood-borne pathogens and other infections, and across the US there are increased incidences of violence in health care settings. 30 Care facilities may be located in settings that pose risks (e.g., having to walk to dark parking lots or working in communities with potential safety issues). To be fully present at work, colleagues need to feel that adequate precautions have been taken to protect them. We define “psychological safety” as people feeling secure and capable of changing; they are free to focus on collective goals and problem prevention rather than on self-protection; and they believe that no one will be humiliated or punished for speaking up. They know that staff will not be punished for human errors in unsafe systems, consistent with a just culture. Psychological safety is a team characteristic rather than an attribute of individuals.

They know that staff will not be punished for human errors in unsafe systems, consistent with a just culture. Psychological safety is a team characteristic rather than an attribute of individuals. It is a climate in which people feel free to express relevant thoughts and feelings or speak up about unsafe conditions without retribution. Psychological safety is founded on respectful interactions by everyone, and disrespectful behavior is rapidly and consistently addressed. People feel confident that others will respond positively when they ask a question, seek feedback, admit a mistake, or propose an idea. Consistent with exemplar safety environments, psychological safety fosters a climate in which raising a dissenting view is expected and respected, error reporting is welcomed, and people are willing to offer ideas, questions, and concerns. 31 This allows for productive discussion and early detection of problems. It’s imperative to put a focus on equity when addressing psychological safety. Every member of the team must feel respected and comfortable speaking up — not just some. A shared sense of psychological safety is a critical input to an effective learning system that leaders must develop. Leaders build psychological safety through the following actions:  Be accessible and approachable;  Acknowledge the limits of current knowledge, frame the work accurately as complex, and show humility and fallibility;  Invite participation;  View failures as learning opportunities;  Use direct, clear language;  Set boundaries about what is acceptable behavior and hold others accountable for boundary violation;32 and  Develop and sustain a just culture.33 Meaning and Purpose Do people find meaning in their work? Do they feel connected to a purpose that is larger than themselves in service to the community? Do they feel that the work they do makes a difference? Daily work is connected to what calls individuals to the health care profession. There is a line of WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 18 sight for each person from daily work to the mission and goals of the organization, and constancy of purpose is evident in the words and actions of leaders. Outside of the health care industry, organizations like Menlo Innovations and Hospitality Quotient put an emphasis on the customer — those served by the organization’s work. Other organizations, such as Barry–Wehmiller, take a more iterative approach to living their mission, behavior, and values with a recurring mission review.

Other organizations, such as Barry–Wehmiller, take a more iterative approach to living their mission, behavior, and values with a recurring mission review. Within the health care industry, finding meaning and purpose may be easier as these are inherent in saving lives and keeping patients healthy and happy. Leaders who frequently talk about the purpose of collective work and encourage conversations about the individual and collective purpose in the organization tap into the meaning that each person brings to their work. Choice and Autonomy The environment supports choice and flexibility in daily lives and work. Do people feel like they have some choice in how they execute their daily responsibilities? Do they have voice in the way things are done in daily work? Are they a part of decisions on processes, changes, and improvements that affect them? Do they have information to make informed contributions to choices in their work? Do team members have the performance improvement skills and support to improve daily work? Participative management and shared governance are two longstanding approaches that offer choice. For example, Starbucks teaches that leaders and managers should listen to staff and include them in solutions. Zappos call center employees do not work from a script and are encouraged to use their imagination to work with customers. Not needing to ask permission enables these sales representatives to succeed.34 Empowered support staff members at Bellin Health can request the resources they need without having to go through leaders. In other health care settings, this means staff are empowered to make improvements and suggest innovations to the use of the electronic health record (EHR) to reduce the administrative burden and tasks which unnecessarily question physician or clinician judgment. This is frequently identified as a “boulder” in experiencing joy in work. From these examples, we learn that colleagues need the freedom and trust to make choices in their daily lives and careers, while following clearly identified necessary rules and guidelines. Recognition and Rewards Effective leaders understand daily work, regularly provide meaningful recognition of colleagues’ contribution to purpose, and celebrate outcomes. Some of the most meaningful rewards are rarely monetary.35,36 Organizations that are more successful in their efforts to improve joy in work begin to move away from traditional approaches that often have limited effectiveness. For example, while important for building camaraderie, parties and social gatherings alone are not sufficient to bring joy in work.

It is the recognition, camaraderie, and celebration of team accomplishments that are validating, not the party itself. Participative Management Joy in work entails leaders creating space to listen, understand, and involve colleagues in providing input into decisions as an essential step in co-creation and participative management. Decision making involves clear communication and consensus building. Participative leaders do three things: WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 19  Engage before acting: They involve others in the beginning stages of an initiative to explain why the work is needed and gain commitment before implementing changes.  Inform: They keep individuals informed of future changes that may impact them.  Listen: They encourage colleagues to share, and listen to individuals at all levels in the organization. They consistently listen to everyone — not only when things are going well. Camaraderie and Teamwork Social cohesion is generated through productive teams, shared understanding, and trusting relationships. Do people feel like they have mutual support and companionship? Do they feel that they are a part of a team, working together toward something meaningful? Do they have a friend or someone who cares about them at work whom they can regularly ask for advice? Do they trust the organization’s leadership? Do leaders regularly practice transparent communication? Do team members regularly express appreciation for each other’s work? Daily Improvement The organization uses improvement science to identify, test, and implement improvements to the system or processes. Teams and the wider organization undertake regular proactive learning from defects and successes. Improvement in processes is part of daily practice. Wellness and Resilience The organization demonstrates that it values health and wellness of all employees. This goes beyond workplace safety to cultivating personal resilience (i.e., the ability to bounce back quickly from setbacks) and stress management; utilizing practices to amplify feelings of gratitude; understanding and appreciation for work/life balance and the whole person and their family; and providing mental health (depression and anxiety) support. Taking care of oneself is part of a larger systems approach to joy in work, not a standalone solution.37 Real-Time Measurement Measurement systems enable regular feedback about system performance to facilitate improvement.

When researchers studied nursing staff experience, the variable contributing the most to retention was management style.38 Other studies evaluating burnout and leadership quality of supervisors showed that positive leadership qualities of physician supervisors influence the wellbeing and engagement of individual physicians. 24 This is not to say that leaders are solely responsible for improving joy in work. Everyone in the organization has an essential part to play. Yet, leaders do have an important role in modeling the expected behaviors and in creating a culture that supports improving joy in work. For this reason, the change ideas that prototype organizations tested (see Appendix B) were guided by leadership behaviors set forth in the IHI High-Impact Leadership Framework.39 It is also important to note the concordance between these critical components for a healthy, happy, and productive workforce WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 20 and the Framework for Safe, Reliable, and Effective Care, which also focuses on many of these elements as well as the prominent role of leadership.40 Senior Leaders Senior leaders are accountable for developing a culture that encourages and fosters trust, improvement, and joy in work. They ensure that improving joy in work is a responsibility at all levels of the organization, beginning with healthy, effective teams and systems. While senior leaders ultimately bear the responsibility for each of the nine components (Figure 3), some components are most under their locus of control. After ensuring physical and psychological safety, they then set the vision and model the way for the transformation that joy in work requires. Senior leaders are responsible for articulating the organization’s purpose, providing a clear line of sight from the work of each person to the mission of the organization, and ensuring meaning and purpose in work. They also ensure fair, equitable systems that embody the fundamental human needs that drive joy in work. By understanding daily work, leaders can recognize the context in which colleagues work, ensure the effectiveness of systems, and identify opportunities to make improvements and celebrate outcomes.

Core leaders have the pivotal role of improving joy in work every day at the point of service. They work with their teams through the process of identifying what matters, addressing impediments through performance improvement in daily work, analyzing what is and is not working well, developing strategies, co-creating solutions with team members, advancing system-wide issues to senior executive champions, and working across departments or sites for joint solutions. This practice of participative management combined with collaborative process improvement makes it possible to meet fundamental human needs.41 As impediments are addressed, staff engagement improves and burnout recedes. Participative management results in greater individual and team productivity, while process improvement increases efficiency.42 One key to the manager’s role is balancing the benefit and burden of improvement. Research by Chris Hayes at St. Joseph’s Health Care in Hamilton, Ontario, shows that improvement efforts, however well-meaning, can raise the workload and stress on the staff.43 For example, installing health information technology has been reported as a cause of burnout, despite its value for safety and efficiency, because the workload in using it falls heavily on busy people, increasing their fatigue and stress. Wise managers select the improvements with high perceived value that ultimately lower the workload when they can. During any improvement effort, they monitor the staff for stress and take steps to lessen and smooth the additional work. Individuals Everyone plays an important role in nurturing joy in the workplace by committing to doing their best, having respectful interactions, identifying opportunities to improve, being part of the solution, speaking up, and cultivating their own wellness and resilience. Each team member has a responsibility to be a good colleague, in addition to role modeling the core values of transparency, civility, and respect. WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 21 Measuring Joy in Work How can one measure “joy”? At present, there is no single validated measure of joy in work. Until there is, leaders need to draw on other indicators that are known to contribute to, or signal trouble for, joy in work.

Measuring joy in work calls for both system-level and local-level measures:  Two or three system-level measures (such as satisfaction, engagement, burnout, turnover, retention, employee wellbeing, workplace injuries, or absenteeism) that can be reviewed at least annually to identify areas for improvement and to track progress over time; and  Local-level measures or assessments that occur more frequently that local leaders can use for improvement on a daily or weekly basis. Daily or weekly assessments of joy in work are initiated and tracked by the staff themselves, along with the core leader of the unit, clinic, or department. The timing of these local assessments matters. Assessments can occur after an event, such as an adverse event; after an interval, such as a day or a week; or at random.44 It’s particularly helpful if data can be stratified by unit, department, discipline, and other demographic factors such as race and ethnicity. By drilling down into different units or groups of staff, organizations can identify areas in which to focus their improvement efforts first. More frequent and tailored data collection, and transparent sharing of results with each work unit and its leaders, allows for more real-time improvement and a better way to track the impact of changes over time. Appendix C includes examples of existing measurement and assessment tools for improving joy in work that organizations may adopt or adapt. In IHI prototype testing, no single measurement system was used across sites. The most practical approach is to leverage existing measurement data (e.g., satisfaction, engagement, burnout, turnover, retention, absenteeism) and measure more frequently over time, if possible. Certain measures will be better indicators of the effectiveness of changes that are tested, and certain tools will work better at some organizations than at others based on a variety of factors (e.g., the type of work in which colleagues are regularly engaged, the capacity of individuals to dedicate time to filling out an assessment). Rather than starting from scratch, many organizations choose to incorporate a few questions from other assessments into their existing assessment tool. Regardless of what is measured, leaders need to track data regularly, make the results transparent, and address issues that are identified as a priority.

The leadership and management practices designed to improve joy in work are some of the most high-leverage changes an organization can undertake since a focus on joy in work simultaneously impacts so many goals embedded within the Triple Aim. Health care is in the beginning stages of recognizing the strategic significance of improving joy in work. The four steps for leaders and the IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work provide an approach for organizations to begin that important journey. The opportunities to learn together how to build cultures that thrive through nurturing joy in daily work are immense. Let us begin and learn together.

The assessment tools described below are intended to help organizations evaluate current levels of joy in work and assess the impact of their improvement efforts related to the components of the IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work described in this paper. System-Level Measures Most health care organizations use standard, proprietary staff satisfaction or engagement surveys. Many vendors exist, including online approaches with templates just for health care. Below are other measurement approaches that our experts and prototype teams have found useful. Net Promoter Score53 The Net Promoter Score (NPS) was originally devised by Harvard Business Review in 2003 to indicate customer engagement. It is adaptable, however, to measure internal team members’ engagement. To determine the internal NPS, ask individuals, “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?” A score of 0 (zero) suggests that they would warn people away from applying and a score of 10 suggests that they would tell everyone they know to apply immediately.

Mayo Clinic Leadership Dimensions Assessment24 The Mayo Clinic has recognized that leadership skill is closely associated with burnout. In surveys that assess the relationship between supervisor leadership qualities and burnout, researchers found that composite leadership scores strongly correlate with the burnout and satisfaction scores of individuals. Tracking leadership capability at the point of service enables senior leaders to identify best practices for spread and to intervene when a leader is struggling. During prototype testing of the IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work, IHI created a short assessment tool that highlighted the most important dimensions of leadership (adapted from the Mayo Clinic assessment): WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 34 When to use this tool: The Leadership Dimensions Assessment can be administered to individuals or to groups. Individual data highlights areas where multiple supervisors or areas of leadership need additional training or improvement. Completing this assessment with a group facilitates conversations about bright spots and areas for improvement. Safety Attitudes Questionnaire54 The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire was developed by Bryan Sexton, Eric Thomas, and Bob Helmreich for organizations to assess their safety culture. This survey elicits health care provider attitudes using six factors: teamwork climate, job satisfaction, management, safety climate, working conditions, and stress recognition. The survey has been validated for use in critical care, operating rooms, pharmacy, ambulatory clinics, labor and delivery, and general inpatient settings. When to use this tool: Use this survey to assess safety culture, identify areas for improvement, and highlight strengths across the organization. The survey can be used to establish baseline data on the existing culture of an organization, to compare culture internally between specialties, or to compare clinical performance between organizations.

When to use this tool: These surveys are used to assess the current safety culture within an organization, raise awareness of patient safety issues, identify areas for improvement, highlight strengths, and provide the ability to view the data over time. This data can be used for internal WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 35 comparisons between specialties or areas of the organization, or external comparison across organizations and the health care industry. Maslach Burnout Inventory56 The Maslach Burnout Inventory, developed by Christina Maslach and Susan Jackson, has been widely recognized and used to gauge burnout. This tool addresses three scales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. When to use this tool: The Maslach Burnout Inventory measures respondents’ relationship to work; it is typically used to assess a group of staff members in an organization, rather than as an individual diagnostic instrument. The group scores can be correlated with other demographic information and used as baseline data to determine the impact of an intervention. Mini Z Burnout Survey57 The Mini Z Burnout Survey, developed by AMA StepsForward, is used to determine stress levels in the health care workplace and how they compare with others in the field. The short, 10-item survey measures burnout and the health care practice environment. When to use this tool: The survey is intended to be distributed annually and completed individually by all providers within a practice. The data can be used as a baseline measure and as a gauge of overall staff wellness over time. Nine-Item Survey to Measure Physician Engagement in Addressing Health Care Disparities58 This survey was developed by Matt Wynia and colleagues at the American Medical Association. Although the tool was designed for clinicians, Henry Ford Health System modified it with permission to use for all staff. Because equity and fairness are central to a joyful workplace, assessing engagement levels can guide efforts for improvement. When to use this tool: The nine-item survey is used to measure engagement (physician or staff) in addressing health disparities.

When to use this tool: The nine-item survey is used to measure engagement (physician or staff) in addressing health disparities. Hackman and Oldham Job Characteristics Model to Job Satisfaction59 The Job Characteristics Model proposed a set of important job qualities, a set of psychological mediators that linked these job characteristics to outcomes, and a set of valued personal and work outcomes. Meaningful work was an important psychological state that mediates between the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance and the outcomes of internal (intrinsic) work motivation, work performance, satisfaction with work, and absenteeism and turnover. When to use this tool: This tool is best used with efforts seeking to improve meaning and purpose in work (e.g., efforts focused on job enrichment and improving the essential nature of the work performed). WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 36 Local-Level Measures Daily Visual Measure To measure joy in work in real time, IHI created a visual measure — a glass jar placed by the elevator into which staff drop one marble each day: a blue marble for a good day, where the individual made progress (), or a tan marble for a day without progress (). A designated staff member counts the number of blue and tan marbles each morning and tracks the total count. A quick glance at the jar enables staff to gauge the daily mood of the organization. Leaders also use this data to assess levels of joy in work over time. When to use this tool: Real-time measurement can be used to engage staff in the daily assessment of joy in work. The data generated by even simple visual measurement tools — like the marble jar, or a whiteboard with two columns (one with a smiling face , one with a frowning face ) on which staff indicate their “joy in work” for that day by putting a checkmark in the appropriate column — can help leaders quickly gauge the current environment on a daily basis. Three Daily Questions Derived from the work Paul O’Neill accomplished while leading Alcoa to be one of the safest organizations in the world, these questions have been adopted by the Lucian Leape Institute.2 To find joy and meaning in their daily work, each person in the workforce must be able to answer affirmatively to three questions each day:  Am I treated with dignity and respect by everyone?","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work_41"}}],["464",{"pageContent":"adopted by the Lucian Leape Institute.2 To find joy and meaning in their daily work, each person in the workforce must be able to answer affirmatively to three questions each day:  Am I treated with dignity and respect by everyone?  Do I have what I need so I can make a contribution that gives meaning to my life?  Am I recognized and thanked for what I do? When to use this tool: Core leaders can use these questions as a basis for conversation in daily huddles or team meetings. Rather than being a measurement tool per se, the three questions can serve as an assessment tool by asking team members, “What would it look like if we could answer ‘yes’ for each question?” Pulse Survey Pulse surveys are a fast and frequent survey system, designed purposefully to avoid complex questions and give quick insight into the health of a company. At IHI, pulse surveys are short (10 questions or fewer) questionnaires on a 5-point Likert scale (“Strongly Agree” to “Strongly Disagree”) that are distributed monthly or quarterly (as opposed to annually). They provide the organization with frequent data to assess overall staff engagement and to see whether the efforts to improve joy in work are making a difference. The use of short, more frequent surveys allows for regular data collection without overwhelming staff or causing survey burnout. IHI includes a set of core questions in every survey, with additional questions focused on a different topic each time the survey is sent out. WHITE PAPER: IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work Institute for Healthcare Improvement • ihi.org 37 IHI Pulse Survey Core Questions (included in every survey):  Overall, IHI is an excellent place to work.  I believe IHI is going in the right direction.  My immediate supervisor cares about the work that I do.  I feel comfortable bringing up problems and tough issues.  I feel that people at IHI respect and take into consideration all views expressed. Example Topic-Specific Questions (included in one survey at a time): January:  I am confident about my future at IHI.  My job makes me feel like I am part of something meaningful.  I am satisfied with my work/life balance.

May:  My immediate supervisor cares about me as a person.  I have a friend at work.  My colleagues at IHI regularly apply the IHI values in their day-to-day interactions.  I am confident that I can participate effectively in efforts to improve IHI processes. September:  The IHI Executive Team cares about the work that I do.  I feel well-informed about important decisions.  I feel recognized for my contribution. November:  My pay is fair for the work that I do.  My benefits package is good compared to others in the industry. When to use this tool: The pulse survey can be used as part of your organization’s internal efforts to improve joy in work, regularly check in with staff members, and identify areas that need improvement. This is a good type of assessment to start with if your organization does not regularly assess staff engagement, satisfaction, and joy in work.

Have you ever questioned why patients are awakened every 2 to 4 hours for vital signs in the hospital when they are stable and in desperate need of sleep? Or wondered why nurses work 12-hour shifts when research shows the multiple adverse outcomes of working lengthy hours for both clinicians and patients? Have you ever thought about the millions of healthcare dollars that could be saved if all primary care providers would follow the evidence-based recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force? Have you ever questioned why it often takes decades for the evidence that is generated from research to be translated into the real world to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes?

Tina Magers (nursing professional development and research coordinator at Mississippi Baptist Health Systems) and her team wondered why catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) affect as many as 25% of all hospitalized patients and questioned what evidence exists that could inform a practice change to reduce these infections in their hospital. (This is Step #0 in the seven-step evidence-based practice [EBP] process, which we describe in detail later in this chapter.) As a result, the team formed the following question in a format called PICOT (Patient population, Intervention or Interest area, Comparison intervention or group, Outcome, and Time; Step #1 in EBP) that facilitated them to conduct an expedited effective search for the best evidence (Magers, 2015): In adult patients hospitalized in a long-term acute care hospital (P), how does the use of a nurse-driven protocol for evaluating the appropriateness of short-term urinary catheter continuation or removal (I) compared to no protocol (C) affect the number of catheter days and CAUTI rates (O) over a six-month postintervention period (T)? The team conducted an evidence search to answer this clinical question using the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 9:51 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

A synthesis of the 15 studies led the team to conclude that early removal of urinary catheters would likely reduce catheter days and CAUTIs (the identified outcomes). Therefore, the team wrote a protocol based on the evidence, listing eight criteria for the continuation of a short-term urinary catheter (Step #4 in EBP).

An outcomes evaluation (Step #5 in the EBP process) revealed a significant reduction in catheter days and a clinically significant reduction of 33% in CAUTIs. The team disseminated the outcomes of the project to internal audiences (e.g., their Nursing Quality Council, the EBP and Research Council, Nursing Leadership Council, Organization Infection Control Committee) and external venues (presentations at regional conferences and a publication in the American Journal of Nursing) (Magers, 2013). (Step #6 in the EBP process.) This is a stellar exemplar of how a team with a spirit of inquiry and a commitment to improving healthcare quality can use the seven-step EBP process discussed in this chapter to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital costs. EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE AND THE QUADRUPLE AIM IN HEALTHCARE Findings from an extensive body of research support that EBP improves the quality and safety of healthcare, enhances health outcomes, decreases geographic variation in care, and reduces costs (McGinty & Anderson, 2008; Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2015; Melnyk, Fineout-Overholt, Gallagher-Ford, & Kaplan, EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 9:51 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

Because EBP has been found to empower clinicians and result in higher levels of job satisfaction (Strout, 2005), it also can assist healthcare systems in achieving the Quadruple Aim. However, regardless of its tremendous positive outcomes, EBP is not standard of care in healthcare systems throughout the United States or the rest of the world due to multiple barriers that have continued to persist over the past decades. Some of these barriers include (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2015; Melnyk et al., 2012a; Melnyk et al., 2012b; Melnyk et al., 2016; Pravikoff, Pierce, & Tanner, 2005; Titler, 2009): • Inadequate knowledge and skills in EBP by nurses and other healthcare professionals • Lack of cultures and environments that support EBP • Misperceptions that EBP takes too much time • Outdated organizational politics and policies • Limited resources and tools available for point-of-care providers, including budgetary investment in EBP by chief nurse executives • Resistance from colleagues, nurse managers, and leaders • Inadequate numbers of EBP mentors in healthcare systems EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 9:51 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

Many interventions or treatments that have been found to improve outcomes through research are not standard of care throughout healthcare systems or have never been used in clinical settings.

It was not until findings from a National Institute of Nursing Research funded randomized controlled trial supported that COPE reduced neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) length of stay in premature infants by 4 days (8 days in preterms less than 32 weeks) and its associated substantial decreased costs that NICUs across the country began to implement the intervention as standard of care (Melnyk & Feinstein, 2009; Melnyk et al., 2006). If not for an improvement in “so-what” outcomes (outcomes of importance to the healthcare system, such as decreased length of stay and costs), COPE would not have been translated into NICU settings to improve outcomes in vulnerable children and their families. On the other hand, many interventions or practices that do not have a solid body of evidence to support them continue to be implemented in healthcare, including double-checking pediatric medications, assessing nasogastric tube placement with air, and taking vital signs every 2 or 4 hours for hospitalized patients. These practices that are steeped in tradition instead of based upon the best evidence result in less than optimum care, poor outcomes, and wasteful healthcare spending.

Incorporated within a clinician’s expertise are: • Clinical judgment • Internal evidence from the patient’s history and physical exam, as well as data gathered from EBP, quality improvement, or outcomes management projects • An evaluation of available resources required to deliver the best practices Some barriers inhibit the uptake of EBP across all venues and disciplines within healthcare. Although the strongest level of evidence that guides clinical practice interventions (i.e., Level I evidence) are systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials followed by well-designed randomized controlled trials (i.e., Level II evidence), there is a limited number of systematic reviews and intervention studies in the nursing profession. Single descriptive quantitative and qualitative studies, which are considered lower-level evidence, continue to dominate the field; see Table 1.1 for levels of evidence that are used to guide clinical interventions. However, all studies that are relevant to the clinical question should be included in the body of evidence that guides clinical practice.

Integrate the evidence with a clinician’s expertise and a patient’s preferences and values. 5. Evaluate the outcome of the practice change.

Step #0: Cultivate a Spirit of Inquiry Within an EBP Culture and Environment The first step in EBP is to cultivate a spirit of inquiry, which is a continual questioning of clinical practices. When delivering care to patients, it is important to consistently question current practices: For example, is Prozac or Zoloft more effective in treating adolescents with depression? Does use of bronchodilators with metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and spacers versus nebulizers in the emergency department (ED) with asthmatic children lead to better oxygenation levels? Does double-checking pediatric medications lead to fewer medication errors? Cultures and environments that support a spirit of inquiry are more likely to facilitate and sustain a questioning spirit in clinicians. Some key components of an EBP culture and environment include (Melnyk, 2014; Melnyk & FineoutOverholt, 2015; Melnyk et al., 2012a, 2016): • An organizational vision, mission, and goals that include EBP • An infrastructure with EBP tools and resources • Orientation sessions for new clinicians that communicate an expectation of delivering evidence-based care and meeting the EBP competencies for practicing registered nurses (RNs) and advanced practice nurses (APNs) EBSCOhost - printed on 4/24/2023 9:51 PM via WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY.

In addition to intervention or treatment questions, other types of PICOT questions include meaning questions, diagnosis questions, etiology questions, and prognosis questions that are addressed in Chapter 3. Step #2: Search for and Collect the Most Relevant Best Evidence After the clinical question is placed in PICOT format with the proper template, each keyword in the PICOT question should be used to systematically search for the best evidence; this strategy is referred to as keyword searching. For example, to gather the evidence to answer the intervention PICOT questions in Step #1, you would first search databases for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials given that they are the strongest levels of evidence to guide practice decisions. However, the search should extend to include all evidence that answers the clinical question. Each keyword or phrase from the PICOT question (e.g., depressed adolescents, Prozac, Zoloft, depressive symptoms) should be entered individually and searched. Searching controlled vocabulary that matches the keywords is the next step in a systematic approach to searching. In the final step, combine each keyword and controlled vocabulary previously searched, which typically yields a small number of studies that should answer the PICOT question. This systematic approach to searching for evidence typically A few databases you’ll want to get familiar with are Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and CINAHL.

See Chapter 5 for one example of an RCA checklist for randomized controlled trials and Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt (2015) for a variety of RCA checklists. After an RCA is completed on each study and found to be a keeper, it is included in the evaluation and synthesis of the body evidence to determine whether a practice change should be made.

Providing the patient with evidence-based information and involving him or her in the decision regarding whether he or she should receive a certain intervention is an important step in EBP. To facilitate greater involvement of patients in making decisions about their care in collaboration with healthcare providers, there has been an accelerated movement in creating and testing patient-decision support tools, which provide evidence-based information in a relatable understandable format (Elwyn et al., 2015).

Step #5: Evaluate Outcomes of the Practice Decision or Change Based on Evidence After making a practice change based on the best evidence, it is critical to evaluate outcomes—the consequences of an intervention or treatment. For example, an outcome of providing a baby with a pacifier might be a decrease in crying. Outcomes evaluation is essential to determine the impact of the practice changes on healthcare quality and health outcomes. It is important to target “so-what” outcomes that the current healthcare system considers important, such as complication rates, length of stay, rehospitalization rates, and costs given that hospitals are currently being reimbursed based on their performance on these outcomes (Melnyk & Morrison-Beedy, 2012). A more thorough discussion of approaches to outcomes evaluation is included in Chapter 7. Step #6: Disseminate the Outcomes of the EBP Decision or Change Silos often exist, even within the same healthcare organization. So that others can benefit from the positive changes resulting from EBP, it is important to disseminate the findings.

RATIONALE FOR THE NEW EBP COMPETENCIES To accelerate the uptake of EBP and ensure that nurses are competent in the delivery of evidence-based care, a new set of EBP competencies was recently developed for practicing RNs and APNs. Competencies are typically developed and used to ensure the delivery of high-quality, safe nursing care, which should be an expectation from the public (American Nurses Association, 2010; Melnyk, Gallagher-Ford, Long, & Fineout-Overholt, 2014). The process of developing these competencies along with the research conducted to further validate them are described in Chapter 2.

Ensuring that clinicians meet the newly established EBP competencies along with creating cultures and environments that support EBP are key strategies to transform the current state of nursing practice and healthcare delivery to its highest level.

These evaluation designs may not match the iterative nature of improvement and may be imposed onto an initiative in a way that is impractical from the perspective of improvers and the communities with whom they work. Consequently, the results of evaluations are often controversial, and attribution remains poorly understood. Improvement initiatives are iterative, adaptive and context-specific. Evaluation approaches and designs must align with these features, specifically in their ability to consider complexity, to evolve as the initiative adapts over time and to understand the interaction with local context. Improvement initiatives often identify broadly defined change concepts and provide tools for care teams to tailor these in more detail to local conditions. Correspondingly, recommendations for evaluation are best provided as broad guidance, to be tailored to the specifics of the initiative. In this paper, we provide practical guidance and recommendations that funders and evaluators can use when developing an evaluation plan for improvement initiatives that seeks to: identify the questions stakeholders want to address; develop the initial program theory of the initiative; identify high-priority areas to measure progress over time; describe the context the initiative will be applied within; and identify experimental or observational designs that will address attribution.

For example, the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) 2 provides guidelines on how to describe the problem an improvement initiative aimed to address, the rationale for the improvement approach, relevant contextual issues, what was found and what the findings mean [1]. Building on SQUIRE, guidance developing the evaluation design of improvement initiatives will be helpful. The current lack of clear guidance for funders, evaluators and improvers on what to include in evaluation proposals can lead to evaluations that do not answer the questions stakeholders want to know, designs that do not match the iterative, adaptive nature of improvement, or designs imposed onto an initiative that are impractical from the perspective of improvers and the communities with whom they work [2, 3]. Consequently, the results of evaluations are often controversial, and attribution remains poorly understood [4]. Improvement initiatives often identify broad change concepts and provide tools to tailor these to local conditions [5, 6]. For example, teams may be encouraged to place handwashing signs in places that make most sense to them, rather than in some pre-specified location. If teams find, as a result of their testing, that improvement occurs, they are encouraged to start testing in other settings, and move towards implementation. Moreover, across several sites, with varying capability and contexts the improvement work is likely to move at varying speeds. In some sites entirely, different approaches may be needed to bring about improvement. As such, improvement initiatives seldom follow a fixed protocol. The optimal evaluation will time specific activities such as data collection to the timing of the improvement activities. For example, there will be no point in collecting data from all settings in a site, if they are only testing in one or two places. Consequently, the timing of evaluation activities will need to follow the timing of the improvement activities. Thus, the activities and focus of improvement initiatives are likely to change over time as those undertaking local testing at the point of care learn what does and does not work with their context. A major aspect of any intervention and its evaluation is the design.

A major aspect of any intervention and its evaluation is the design. Much literature exists on the importance of including the evaluation team from the start of any project or program design. One approach, described by Leviton and colleagues, based on Evaluability Assessment, offers guidance relevant to improvement initiatives [2]. An evaluability assessment features components that include involving the intended users of evaluation information, clarifying the intended program, exploring the likely impact of the program, reaching agreement on needed changes in activities or goals, exploring alternative evaluation designs and agreeing on evaluation priorities and intended users of the information. Leviton describes an iterative process that funders and evaluators can follow to understand the program and develop the most appropriate evaluation design given available resources and time. The Evaluability Assessment approach can be used to guide the development of an evaluation design for improvement projects and programs by: • Agreeing among all key stakeholders, including the funder, improvement and evaluation teams, on the Theory of Change • Agreeing among all key stakeholders, on the evaluation design, including: • The evaluation questions • Formative and/or summative approaches • Availability and use of data to assess attribution • Available human and financial resources In this paper, we use the Evaluability Assessment approach to guide the design of evaluations for understanding attribution in improvement initiatives. We identify tools and approaches commonly used in the improvement field to provide practical guidance and recommendations for developing a proposal to evaluate improvement initiatives. Agreeing on the Theory of Change For improvement initiatives, the theory of change includes three interdependent pieces: the ‘What’, the ‘Context’ and the ‘How’, and below we summarize and recommend existing tools and approaches for describing these, and how they may be included in an evaluation plan: The What The ‘what’ describes the rationale for what changes, if made locally, may lead to improved outcomes. In improvement, Driver Diagrams are often used to illustrate the primary drivers the improvement team has identified and predict, if implemented, will lead to improvement [7]. From these primary drivers, detailed secondary drivers are identified and used by improvement teams to generate specific change ideas for local testing.

The three primary drivers of the intended outcome are prioritizing increased access, activating local champions, and reliably delivering a clinical pre-natal care bundle. Developing Driver Diagrams requires clinical knowledge, critical appraisal skills, quantitative data skills and facilitation skills (Box 1). Context There are many considerations when seeking to understand the context within which an improvement initiative is conducted. In addition, context can change and be an active component of an initiative. There are growing options available for characterizing some aspects of context. To fully understand the impact of context, an evaluation plan must allow for the possibility that additional contextual themes will emerge [8, 9]. Contextual exploration likely requires social science input, including qualitative methods that consider the following: • How context may interact with the ‘what’ and ‘how’ over the course of the improvement initiative • An approach to describe how the context varies across participating sites • A description of the process the improvement and evaluation teams will use to identify and measure the likely impact of context on the improvement initiative (Box 2). The How The evaluation plan must describe the entire intervention, including how people at the point of care are expected to test, implement or scale-up the changes depicted in the Driver Diagram. For example, if an IHI Breakthrough Series is used, the evaluation plan must describe the rationale for how the activities (learning sessions, action periods) will result in local change in the timescales available [10]. 30 Parry et al. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/intqhc/article-abstract/30/suppl_1/29/4852806 by Adam Ellsworth, Adam Ellsworth on 24 April 2018 Logic models are used to depict the causal pathway from available resources to program activities to local short-term process changes, to long-term process changes and to improved outcomes [11].

Example of a Driver Diagram summarizing ’What’ changes the initiative predicts will lead to the improvement goal. Box 1 Improving newborn mortality initiative The recommendations can be illustrated by following the design of an evaluation for an initiative to improve newborn mortality in 15 maternity centers in a region of a low-income country. Following the evaluability evaluation approach: Agreeing on the theory of change: The What: The improvement initiative leaders summarized the changes they recommended teams embarking on the improvement initiative follow in the form of a Driver Diagram (Fig. 1). The primary drivers of change they selected were to expand access to pre-natal care, activate community members to promote health and connect peers with health services and reliable delivery of pre-natal care bundle. Each of these primary drivers had associated secondary drivers, for example, to expand access to pre-natal care, the improvement leaders identified the need to provide supportive community structures, attractive health services, communication and transportation and remove cost barriers for pregnant women. Box 2 Agreeing on the theory of change: The Context: Following a series of interviews with participants, the improvement leaders understood that many of the participants were new to quality improvement, and required additional training in improvement methods. In addition, they found some variation among the participating sites in terms of leadership engagement, and the extent to which the goals of the initiative aligned with the strategic priorities of the organizations.

Developing the evaluation design As the theory of change is developed, appropriate evaluation questions and designs must be developed simultaneously. For key stakeholders and evaluators to agree on an evaluation design, the evaluability assessment approach recommends they review the theory of change and decide what evaluation questions they want to address, whether to use a formative or summative approach, and what data to collect. Only then will they be able to identify options for designs that will address attribution. The final choice of design will then be made in relation to available resources. Agreeing on the evaluation questions A key component of improvement initiatives is having a clear goal, agreed by stakeholders for what will be achieved. An evaluation plan must demonstrate an understanding of the major stakeholders and their roles, including a description of their evaluation goals and how the evaluation will align with them. For example, a government agency may want to know the overall impact of the initiative, and the cost to achieve wider scale-up.

Box 3 Agreeing on the theory of change: The How: The improvement leaders initially proposed to follow an IHI Breakthrough Series Collaborative design, where a series of three learning sessions, bringing together participating teams are conducted. The learning sessions aim to teach improvement methods that will encourage participants to test local changes aligned with the content of the driver diagram. Between learning sessions, participants are expected to test changes and share learning with each other. Based on feedback related to the Context, the improvement leaders decided to add additional coaching calls with the aim of strengthening improvement capability within participating teams. The improvement leaders summarized the How into a Logic Model (Fig. 2). 32 Parry et al.

Formative evaluation aims to improve programs as they evolve. As shown in Table 1, the assignment of an initiative into one of the improvement phases of innovation, testing, and spread and scale-up can guide the choice of using summative or formative evaluation approaches. In the innovation and testing phases, the ‘What’ and ‘How’ are under development, and will adapt over time. In the spread phase, the ‘what’ and ‘how’ will be more developed, and less likely to adapt over time. For initiatives in the innovation and testing phase, formative approaches are primarily used and feature mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, to capture how, where and with what impact models are being adapted over time. For initiatives in the spread and scale-up phase, summative approaches are primarily used and feature quantitative methods to estimate the overall impact of the model. Formative evaluation approaches should be considered in the spread and scale-up phase, particularly if adaptation and issues related to context are likely to occur during spread and scale-up (Box 5).

They decided to focus their evaluation questions primarily on how the changes would be implemented and secondarily on the overall impact of successful implementation on patient outcomes. The evaluation questions were: 1.1) To what extent can all the changes be implemented? 1.2) To what extent did the implementation vary from the model across settings? 1.3) What are barriers and facilitators to implementing the changes? 1.4) What are the barriers and facilitators to undertaking the improvement activities? 2) What is the impact of the overall model on patient outcomes?

These allow the evaluation to explore overall impact and variation across sites. To understand progress towards the goals of an improvement project and how progress can be attributed to the theory of change, several high-priority measures are required, aligning with progress on the Logic Model and Driver Diagram. In the Newborn Mortality example, the Driver Diagram in Fig. 1 and Logic Model in Fig. 2 suggest an outcome measure of newborn mortality, and process measures indicating access to pre-natal care, community champion activation, and reliability of care bundle delivery. Additional key measures on the causal pathway suggest those indicating gains in knowledge and application of improvement methods. As suggested in Fig. 2, specific dates by which measures are predicted to reach a specific target are needed. Measurement should focus on the overall outcomes, areas where the logic model suggests are high-leverage drivers or steps that are critical to have achieved, as well as areas where there exists a lack of consensus in the strength of evidence related to a step. Details should be provided regarding how frequently the data will be collected and how it is collected and validated. The data are ideally available in a format that allows for analysis of variation across sites. Measurement by participants at the point of care is an important feature of most improvement initiatives, and evaluators might consider building on existing participant data collection activities. However, if they do, it will be important to pay specific attention to data quality issues. As the limitations of data collected by participants might be difficult to overcome (e.g. data quality changing over time as the data collection skills of participants improve, and the positive bias that can be introduced when workers rate their own performance), evaluations desiring high internal validity might need outcomes to be measured by objective data collectors (e.g. high-quality surveyors). Finally, consideration should be given to measures that indicate unintended consequences, indicating whether a loss of quality has occurred elsewhere in the system (balancing measures) (Box 6). Assessing attribution With an understanding of the above areas, several mixed-method formative and summative evaluation designs relevant to the evaluation questions can be developed. We recommend using quantitative methods to estimate the impact or attribution of the initiative, and explore variation across settings; and qualitative methods to explore questions related to how or why an initiative did or did not progress and to understand issues related to adaptation of the models being implemented [12].

To assess attribution, the extent to which measured improvement results from the initiative, evaluation plans must describe a counterfactual—what is likely to happen if the initiative is not introduced. Table 2 summarizes approaches that can be used as the core of an evaluation design to assess attribution. Randomization should be explored where possible to assess attribution of specific aspects of the improvement initiative. We recommend evaluators base their design on one of these approaches and build the qualitative methodology, exploring questions of how and why around them. Table 3 summarizes additional issues for evaluators to consider depending on the Improvement Phase of the Initiative (Box 7). Availability of human and financial resources Developing, establishing and maintaining data collection systems are vital to the success of improvement initiatives, but is resource intensive. An evaluation may also want to extend data collection to comparator sites, increasing resource requirement. Moreover, surveys, site visits, and qualitative interviews, and ethnographic techniques whilst providing valuable insights, are resource intensive. Following the Evaluability Assessment approach, the evaluation designers will need to re-visit and amend the questions they identified earlier (see 3.1), and prioritize resources accordingly (Box 8). Box 5 Agreeing on the evaluation design: Formative and/or summative approaches The evaluation team recommended a formative approach to address evaluation questions 1.1–1.4, where the evaluation team would work with the improvement leads to collate and analyse process and outcome data at quarterly intervals to provide feedback on progress. For question 2, the evaluation team recommended a summative approach, where they would collate and analyse data at the end of the improvement work to assess overall impact on patient outcomes.

We focus these recommendations on designs that allow for the attribution of improvement results to improvement initiatives. These recommendations can be used to inform the development and review of Requests for Proposals, or in discussion with improvement practitioners when developing projects or programs. Additionally, our recommendations align with the SQUIRE 2 [1].

The validity of this design can be strengthened by having a separate control group. Random allocation may be used to allocate to the intervention). Cluster randomized controlled trials Randomization allocation of subjects or sites to an intervention or control group can be introduced if it is possible and appropriate. The internal validity of the above evaluation designs are stronger if study clusters such as health facilities are randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Validity can be further strengthened by matching cluster groups on attributes associated with study outcomesa a E.g. in a two-armed study, create pairs of health facilities with similar attributes, then randomly assign one facility per pair to the intervention group, with the remaining facility being a control. Learning about improvement 35 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/intqhc/article-abstract/30/suppl_1/29/4852806 by Adam Ellsworth, Adam Ellsworth on 24 April 2018 Recognizing the call for strengthening the evidence-base, the use of randomization in evaluation designs should also be explored [13]. Moreover, evaluation designs must consider the iterative, adaptive nature of improvement. Perhaps the most important aspect to look for in evaluation is the flexibility of evaluation design to respond to likely adaptations in how the improvement activities are applied across local contexts, recognizing that some sites will move more quickly than others. The complex adaptive nature of improvement requires additional interpretative work in evaluation design to fully understand The What and How and their interaction with The Context. As Dixon-Woods and others have argued, such work will benefit from sound theoretic underpinnings to understand underlying concepts and themes related to the ‘What’ and ‘How’ that may be applicable to other settings [14, 15].

Those who initiate change will have a better opportunity to manage the change that is inevitable. —William Pollard I nternational health statistics demonstrate that the United States trails other developed nations in many public health indicators. A recent survey of 11 high- income nations found that the United States is an outlier among surveyed countries in regard to ensuring access to health care, revealing that roughly one-third (33%) of American adults went without recommended care, declined to see a doctor when they were sick, or did not fill a prescription due to cost (Osborn et al., 2016). Regarding both infant and maternal mortality, the United States has continuously ranked poorly in past decades when compared to other developed nations (United Health Foundation, 2016). This trend has endured in recent years, with the United States ranking 26th in infant deaths among 29 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations, with 6.1 deaths per 1,000 live births (compared to 2.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in the topranked nation, Finland) (MacDorman et al., 2014). Furthermore, although the United States is by far the highest among 39 OECD nations in health expenditures, the country 270 ranks near the bottom in life expectancy at birth—landing at 26th for men and 29th for women (Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, 2014). With rankings such as these, it is evident that we need to improve public health services and outcomes in the United States. Over the past three decades, U.S. public health organizations have increasingly undertaken a variety of efforts to ensure and improve the quality of their services. In recent years, accreditation has become part of a national focus to advance the quality and performance of public health. At the same time, public health agencies have been implementing quality improvement using proven methods, such as the Model for Improvement, Lean, and Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles described throughout this text and elsewhere (Deming, 2000; Langley et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2012).

Efforts such as these indicate that public health is moving beyond a series of projects and tools toward adopting continuous quality improvement (CQI) as a means of achieving a public health system that is effective, efficient, and in step with other industrialized nations around the world. Objectives In this chapter, we provide an overview of the adoption and institutionalization of CQI in U.S. public health organizations. We begin by providing a brief history of CQI in public health. We then describe current efforts to promote CQI and explore the opportunities, challenges and progress of public health organizations in the adoption and institutionalization of CQI, including the important role of accreditation. Finally, we conclude with a practical example/case study of how a public health agency has applied quality improvement methods and tools and their steps toward institutionalizing CQI. ▸ Clarifying Key Terms In public health, quality has been defined as “the degree to which policies, programs, services, and research for the population increase the desired health outcomes and conditions in which the population can be healthy” (U.S. DHHS, 2008, p. 2). Quality assurance is the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the performance of an organization or its programs to ensure that standards (usually set by public health experts) of quality are being met. Quality improvement involves using formal methods and tools in designing and redesigning systems to meet customers’ needs by testing and implementing ideas from evidence-based strategies, front-line staff, and customers. In public health, quality improvement has been described as a “distinct management process and set of tools and techniques that are coordinated to ensure that departments [local public health agencies] consistently meet their communities’ health needs and strive to improve the health status of their populations” (Riley et al., 2010, p. 5). Continuous quality improvement (CQI) in public health organizations is a structured organizational infrastructure and culture for involving staff in planning and executing a continuous flow of improvements to provide quality that meets or exceeds the expectations of communities. It focuses on systems change and generally includes these characteristics: a link to the organization’s strategic plan, a quality council made up of the organization’s top leadership, quality improvement training programs for staff, a mechanism for priorit","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality_1"}}],["508",{"pageContent":"or exceeds the expectations of communities.

An organization that is committed to CQI may have both quality improvement and quality assurance processes, but the predominant focus is on quality improvement. Clarifying Key Terms 271 ▸ History of Actions to Promote CQI in Public Health In 1988, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, The future of public health, declared that the United States “has lost sight of its public health goals and has allowed the system of public health to fall into disarray” (p. 1). Following the 1988 IOM report, public health experts and analysts promoted a variety of methods and frameworks for changing the public health system and improving performance. By the mid-1990s, the IOM, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Public Health Association, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) adopted the 10 essential public health services framework that describes the key public health activities that all communities should address. Using that framework, the National Public Health Performance Standards Program developed three assessment instruments to help state and local public health agencies identify gaps in achieving optimal performance and inform quality improvement efforts (CDC, 2015). During this time of standards development, the Turning Point initiative, jointly funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation and directed by NACCHO, sought to transform U.S. public health systems into more community-based and collaborative organizations working to prevent disease and injury, protect the public from threats to their health, and promote healthy behaviors (Turning Point, 2006). Turning Point emphasized the use of performance standards in conjunction with measurement and reporting as well as the institution of quality improvement methods to manage change and achieve quality. Over time, public health organizations became increasingly interested in standardizing and ensuring quality public health services, which led to a focus on national public health accreditation (Stone & Davis, 2012). In late 2004, the RWJF established the Exploring Accreditation Steering Committee to develop recommendations for implementing a voluntary national accreditation program, and, in 2005, launched","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality_2"}}],["509",{"pageContent":"national public health accreditation (Stone & Davis, 2012). In late 2004, the RWJF established the Exploring Accreditation Steering Committee to develop recommendations for implementing a voluntary national accreditation program, and, in 2005, launched the Multi-State Learning Collaborative (MLC) to explore the feasibility of voluntary national public health agency accreditation and collect data on existing accreditation practices (Beitsch et al., 2006; Russo, 2007). In the first phase of the MLC, five states with mature accreditation or assessment programs received 1-year grants to enhance their existing performance assessment and share information with the Steering Committee and one another. Following that phase, the Steering Committee recommended a national model for accreditation, which was subsequently endorsed by NACCHO and the Association of State and Territorial Health Organizations (ASTHO), among others. In 2007, the second phase of the MLC began and 10 states received 1-year grants to focus on quality improvement in the context of accreditation and assessment. The states explored ways to improve their own accreditation and assessment programs, shared their tools and resources, conducted training in quality improvement, initiated quality improvement practices, and informed the planning for the national public health accreditation program (Gillen et al., 2010). The third phase began in 2008, when 16 states received 3-year grants to prepare for national voluntary accreditation, support the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) in the development of the national voluntary accreditation program, and bolster use of quality improvement methods in local and state health departments through mini- collaboratives in each state (Joly et al., 2010). The mini-collaboratives—teams of local and state health department representatives and other partners—implemented quality improvement projects targeting public health processes (e.g., developing a community health 272 Chapter 11 Continuous Quality Improvement in U.S. Public Health Organizations profile) and outcomes in specific topic areas (e.g., tobacco, immunizations) (Gillen et al., 2010; Joly et al., 2010). Also in 2008, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. DHHS) released the Consensus Statement on Quality in the Public Health System, which, for the first time, framed a clear, uniform definition of quality for the public health system: “the degree to which policies, programs, services, and research for the population increase the","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality_3"}}],["510",{"pageContent":"Consensus Statement on Quality in the Public Health System, which, for the first time, framed a clear, uniform definition of quality for the public health system: “the degree to which policies, programs, services, and research for the population increase the desired health outcomes and conditions in which the population can be healthy” (p. 2). The Consensus Statement also identified nine quality aims for the public health system: population- centered, equitable, proactive, health promoting, risk reducing, vigilant, transparent, effective, and efficient (Honoré et al., 2011; U.S. DHHS, 2008). Providing a national quality framework through the Consensus Statement was deemed necessary to facilitate consistent implementation of quality improvement in the daily routines of public health practitioners and their organizations. Another purpose of the Consensus Statement was to demonstrate a national commitment to quality improvement application throughout all parts of the public health system, including finance, programs, management, governance, and education (Honoré, 2009; Honoré et al., 2011). After the release of the Consensus Statement, U.S. DHHS charged the IOM with developing quality measures for the 12 leading health indicator priorities and 26 leading health indicators in Healthy People 2020 (IOM, 2013). The report provides suggestions for how government, communities, funders, hospitals, and other health care organizations could use the quality measures to guide decisions related to population health. In 2010, the CDC Office for State, Tribal, Local and Territorial Support began what became a 4-year National Public Health Improvement Initiative (NPHII) to support health departments to address performance improvement, accelerating public health accreditation readiness activities, and sharing practice-based evidence. The initiative supported 73 state, tribal, local, and territorial public health organizations via the Prevention and Public Health Fund of the Affordable Care Act. By the end of the second year of the program, “[a]pproximately 26% of awardees had completed an organizational PHAB selfassessment, 72% had established at least 1 of the 4 components of a performance management system, and 90% had conducted QI activities focused on increasing efficiencies and/or effectiveness” (McLees et al., 2014, p. 29). ▸ Factors Affecting the Ongoing Adoption and Institutionalization of CQI in Public Health Accreditation Programs Accreditation programs at the state and","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin & Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 12 - Health Service Accreditation - A Strategy to Promote and Improve Safety and Quality_4"}}],["511",{"pageContent":"and/or effectiveness” (McLees et al., 2014, p. 29). ▸ Factors Affecting the Ongoing Adoption and Institutionalization of CQI in Public Health Accreditation Programs Accreditation programs at the state and national level have served as major drivers of the promotion and adoption of CQI among state and local public health departments. State accreditation programs were instrumental in guiding the development of a national accreditation program, in addition to helping drive CQI in health departments. North Carolina has been one of the leaders at the state level. Indeed, North Carolina was the first state to pilot a state accreditation program as well as the first to mandate accreditation for all of its local health departments (Reed et al., 2009). All 84 North Carolina local health departments have gone through initial accreditation and have also been re-accredited as of July, 2018 (A. Thomas, personal communication, July 12, 2018). The North Carolina program has clearly demonstrated the potential to drive CQI in health departments. A case study by Stone and Davis (2012) illustrates the link between CQI and public health accreditation in local public health agencies in North Carolina. Today, there are three ongoing state accreditation Factors Aff ecting the Ongoing Adoption and Institutionalization of CQI in Public Health 273 programs in North Carolina, Michigan, and Missouri. Michigan’s statewide program has many similarities to North Carolina’s, and Missouri’s program is currently being updated and revised (D. Stone, personal communication, March 4, 2017). Building on the early accreditation experience in states, the PHAB was established in 2007 to manage and promote a national voluntary accreditation program for state, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments (PHAB, 2013). The PHAB program has been very successful in engaging health departments across the United States. As of March 2017, PHAB has accredited 179 state, local, and tribal health departments (23, 155, and 1, respectively), and there are an additional 158 health departments currently in the PHAB accreditation process pipeline (PHAB, 2017). Accreditation, whether in public health, in other areas of health care, or in related industries, has traditionally been primarily a quality assurance strategy focused on meeting standards set by external experts.

In some industries, such efforts have not been particularly successful or popular; of note, they are often unpopular with workers because of the focus on human error, rather than systems, as the source of most problems. However, Bender and Halverson (2010) describe the approach to PHAB accreditation as follows: “Unlike some health-related agencies and services that are accredited or otherwise regulated, the PHAB board of directors has set the public health accreditation work solidly on the cornerstone of CQI. In other words, accreditation is a means to an end, not an end unto itself ” (p. 80). Due to PHAB’s rapidly expanding reach, and its focus on CQI, PHAB accreditation has been a major driver of adoption of CQI in all public health settings. Further, PHAB requirements also foster institutionalization of CQI, especially its annual report process for accredited health departments, wherein the accredited health department is required to report on the elements of CQI that it has implemented, and plans to implement in the coming year. Indeed, recent evaluation data from the PHAB program reveals that 92% of PHAB participants agree or strongly agree that the PHAB accreditation process led to a “strong QI culture.” Further, focus groups revealed that PHAB accreditation changed CQI use in their health department from periodic to more institutionalized (Kronstadt et al., 2016).

Governmental and Nonprofit Organizations Numerous governmental and nonprofit organizations are providing substantial leadership in promotion of CQI in the U.S. public health system. These well-respected organizations have the visibility and influence to advance CQI in public health and have been doing so over the past decade. We have already mentioned some of the most influential: ASTHO, NACCHO, CDC, U.S. DHHS, PHAB, and RWJF.

Population Health Improvement Partners offers numerous training and technical assistance programs to help public health departments and their community partners learn and apply CQI. In addition, Population Health Improvement Partners provides a free online set of resources that includes a step-by-step guide for executing a quality improvement project, online learning modules, and a database of examples of quality improvement projects. Both PHF and Population Health Improvement Partners have published extensively about their CQI work and related lessons learned in public health settings. Evidence-Based Strategies and Programs To improve public health, it is increasingly acknowledged that the field has to generate, and more effectively, apply evidence-based strategies, interventions, and programs, while avoiding investment in those that have uncertain benefit (other than in research and evaluation activities) or have been proven to have no effect. The evidence base for public health interventions is limited in some areas, and additional funding for research on developing new approaches and documenting the effectiveness of current public health interventions is necessary (U.S. DHHS, 2009).

More research and development is needed to increase the availability and usability of evidence-based approaches; likewise, more educational and training opportunities are needed to ensure the effective application of these approaches. Innovative Partnerships Local and state public health agencies alone cannot address many important public health problems, such as the increasing burden of chronic diseases. There is growing recognition that a coalition of partners from complementary organizations is often necessary. Public–private and other innovative partnerships will likely become increasingly important, especially as resources for public health continue to contract in many states.

Local partnerships can be an excellent way to leverage limited public health resources. One major opportunity for innovative partnerships is the 2014 changes in IRS requirements of nonprofit hospitals (78% of U.S. hospitals) through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which mandates that they conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) every 3 years and collaborate with their local health department to do so, including developing strategies to address the priorities (James, 2016). An excellent example of this type of collaboration in action is Western North Carolina (WNC) Healthy Impact.

The initiative currently involves 10 local partnerships and plans to expand to a total of 35 partnerships by 2020. Finally, numerous states have used innovative partnerships to enhance the adoption and institutionalization of CQI in public health settings. For example, Population Health Improvement Partners, the North Carolina Division of Public Health, the North Carolina Association of Local Health Directors, the North Carolina Area Health Educations Centers, and the North Carolina Institute for Public Health partnered to provide basic and advanced CQI training for all local health departments and all state health programmatic areas, beginning in 2009. To date, nearly all of North Carolina’s 84 local health departments have been trained, as have dozens of state health department programs, yielding impressive improvements and return on investment (Davis et al., 2016; Crawley-Stout et al., 2016). The Rhode Island Department of Health has used multiple funding sources and initiatives, such as its Home Visiting Collaborative Improvement & Innovation Network (COIIN), to provide CQI training for numerous state maternal and child health programs and their staff and all of its local partner agencies in collaboration with Population Health Improvement Partners. Financing of Public Health Organizations In many states, governmental public health agencies have been under substantial financial strain related to governmental austerity, even during an expanding economy. In fact, the CDC’s budget (nearly three-fourths of which funds state and local communities) has declined by over $1.5 billion (15%) in the past decade (Segal & Martín, 2017). New and innovative approaches to financing local and state public health agencies are greatly needed and can help improve the population’s health as governmental funding is shrinking.

For instance, public health organizations could benefit from testing and adapting financial approaches that have been successful in other industries, such as economic impact and return on investment analyses. CQI relates to these financial challenges in at least three ways. First, implementing CQI should help reduce overall costs while increasing quality, just as it has in many other industries and organizations (Spear & Bowen, 1999). Reducing costs and inefficiencies can help increase capacity and allow for a greater focus on population health improvement. Indeed, the CDC and other U.S. DHHS agencies are beginning to tie incorporation of CQI into their grants to state and local public health agencies and programs. Second, if the financing of public health services remains focused Factors Aff ecting the Ongoing Adoption and Institutionalization of CQI in Public Health 277 on funding specific services and programs rather than infrastructure and other more flexible uses, then public health agencies will likely have great difficulty investing in the infrastructure needed for CQI. Lesneski (2012) presents a case study describing the link between quality management and the analysis of financial indicators in a local health department. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we believe the increasing focus on value (higher quality at a lower cost) in the ongoing health care transformation in the United States, which is largely driven by the ACA, and the need to control the rapid increases in health care costs, will drive health systems to have a greater focus on improving the health of the populations they serve. U.S. DHHS has set a goal of linking 50% of Medicare fee-for-service payments to quality or value through alternative payment models by 2018 (CMS, 2017). An unhealthy population will have much higher health care costs, thus opening the door for innovative funding models between public health and health care entities as they strive for the mutually beneficial goal of improving the health of a population to create higher health care value. (See Chapter 14 for further discussion of the importance of focusing on value in health care and CQI).

CQI in a Local Public Health Agency: Macon County, North Carolina After becoming accredited through North Carolina’s accreditation program in 2008, the Macon County, North Carolina, Public Health Department began to focus on changing its quality culture. They established a QI council and part-time position for a quality program manager and began to implement a quality improvement program. Over the course of 2 years, they trained staff and leadership in quality improvement tools and methods, including Lean (see Chapters 4 and 5). During this time, staff members completed small quality improvement projects, which helped them apply the concepts they were learning and secure buy-in throughout the organization. After staff were trained and had completed a few successful small-scale projects, the health department began focusing on “projects that would have a greater impact on the organization’s overall performance, improve patient/customer service outcomes, and achieve demonstrable cost savings.” One such project aimed to improve the appointment scheduling process by seeing all patients within 72 hours of requesting an appointment, while also improving patient and staff satisfaction. The team participated in a rapid cycle improvement event (or, kaizen event) that involved using Lean and Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, performing a gemba walk (direct observation of the work), creating work flow diagrams and detailed process maps, and generating and testing change ideas. Soon after, the clinics were scheduling patients for visits in less than 72 hours. Their no-show rates decreased, visit numbers increased, staff downtime decreased, and both patient and staff satisfaction increased. 278 Chapter 11 Continuous Quality Improvement in U.S. Public Health Organizations References Beitsch, L.

Although public health organizations are still early in the process of institutionalizing CQI compared to organizations in many other industries, they have made remarkable progress and adoption in the second decade of the 21st century, particularly with the support of accreditation locally and nationally. The increased attention placed on the adoption of CQI in public health is both timely and encouraging. Numerous factors are presented to explain the growth of CQI in public health and, most important, the substantial progress that has been made toward true institutionalization of CQI in public health. Among those factors is accreditation, with similarities to the impact accreditation has had on health care globally (see Chapter 12). Continuing to use accreditation efforts to promote CQI and learning from health care and other industries will help accelerate widespread adoption and institutionalization of CQI. Public health organizations that adopt CQI to help employees work as a team, address gaps in performance by analyzing and redesigning processes, and encourage innovation to meet the needs of communities hold the promise for a healthier future, both in the United States and throughout the world. Leveraging this success, the health department began to spread quality improvement initiatives to other areas of the organization and focused on projects related to the client feedback process, child health visit flow, and vaccine storage and management among others. To keep staff informed of the organization’s quality improvement work, as well as foster ongoing staff engagement, the health department keeps an electronic directory of their work (including project aim statements, meeting notes, process maps and flow diagrams, as well as other team-related communication) and highlights activities and results in the hallways of their organization. They also reinvest cost savings from the projects into other vital activities of the health department. Overall, the health department’s continuous improvement efforts have led to organizational efficiency as well as improved care and patient experience (Bruckner, See, & Randolph, 2013).

Sollecito and Julie K. Johnson We are here to make another world. —W. Edwards Deming Continuous quality improvement (CQI) comes in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes and has been referred to by many names. It is an example of the evolutionary process that started with industrial applications, primarily in Japan, and has now spread throughout the world, affecting many economic sectors, including health care. In this introductory chapter, we define CQI, trace its history and adaptation to health care, and consider its ongoing evolution. References to subsequent chapters and a previously published volume of case studies (McLaughlin, Johnson, & Sollecito, 2012) provide greater detail and illustrations of CQI approaches and successes as applied to health care. Despite the evolution and significant progress in the adoption of CQI theory, methods, and applications, the need for greater efforts in quality improvement in health care continues unabated. For example, a major study from 2010 encompassing more than 2,300 admissions in 10 North Carolina hospitals demonstrated that much more needs be done to improve the quality and safety in U.S. hospitals, and it may have implications for health care globally. It found that “patient harms,” including preventable medical errors and other patient safety measures, remained common with little evidence of improvement during the 6-year study period 1 from 2002 to 2007 (Landrigan et al., 2010). In recent years, there has been substantial progress in the greater diffusion of CQI in health care in certain sectors. For example, there has been broader institutionalization of CQI in public health in the United States, much of which can be attributed to the broader application of accreditation requirements; this is described in Chapters 11 and 12. Great progress has also been seen in the broader adoption of CQI in resourcepoor countries, as documented in Chapter 13. However, with greater complexity in health care comes greater challenges; for example, greater uses of technology bring benefits and risks, as described in Chapter 4, and more widespread applications of evidence-based interventions do not necessarily provide improved outcomes (Wandersman, Alia, Cook, Hsu, & Ramaswamy, 2016). As a result, the challenge of how to cross the quality chasm (","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_0"}}],["526",{"pageContent":"widespread applications of evidence-based interventions do not necessarily provide improved outcomes (Wandersman, Alia, Cook, Hsu, & Ramaswamy, 2016). As a result, the challenge of how to cross the quality chasm (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2001) in health care clearly remains, and our goal in this text is to help to shed light on the scope of the problem and potential solutions. ▸ Definitions Quality in Health Care The exact definition of quality in health care varies somewhat for the various sectors of health care. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a broad-based definition that encompasses global health care as: “the extent to which health care services provided to individuals and patient populations improve desired health outcomes. In order to achieve this, health care must be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable and people-centered.” Safe. Delivering health care that minimizes risks and harm to service users, including avoiding preventable injuries and reducing medical errors. Effective. Providing services based on scientific knowledge and evidence-based guidelines. Timely. Reducing delays in providing and receiving health care. Efficient. Delivering health care in a manner that maximizes resource use and avoids waste. Equitable. Delivering health care that does not differ in quality according to personal characteristics such as gender, race, ethnicity, geographical location, or socioeconomic status. People-centered. Providing care that takes into account the preferences and aspirations of individual service users and the culture of their community (World Health Organization, 2017). Quality Assurance Quality assurance (QA) is closely related to, and sometimes confused with, CQI. QA focuses on conformance quality, which is defined as “conforming to specifications; having a product or service that meets predefined standards” (McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006, p. 37). QA is sometimes the primary goal of accreditation processes, for example in the 1980s and 90s hospital accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) now known as The Joint Commission (TJC) was primarily focused on meeting predefined standards (i.e., QA). More recently, especially in public health, accreditation is intended to promote CQI (see Chapters 11 and 12). QA is sometimes included in broader CQI initiatives as a way of defining baseline care, as an interim goal or as part of the process definition, but CQI is much","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_1"}}],["527",{"pageContent":"to promote CQI (see Chapters 11 and 12). QA is sometimes included in broader CQI initiatives as a way of defining baseline care, as an interim goal or as part of the process definition, but CQI is much broader in its goals than QA. A related concept that should be mentioned briefly is quality control (QC), which was widely used in the early development of 2 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement procedures to ensure industrial product quality. Various definitions can be found for this term (Spath & Kelly, 2017), and in some cases, QC is confused with QA. It is our experience that QC is synonymous with inspection of products or other process outputs with the goal of determining which products should be rejected and/or reworked, often accompanied by counting the number of “defects.” The role and weaknesses of inspection (in comparison to CQI) are further discussed by Ross (2014) as part of the evolutionary development of CQI. Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) A succinct but accurate definition of CQI in health care is: “the combined efforts of everyone—health care professionals, patients and their families, researchers, payers, planners and educators—to make changes that will lead to better patient outcomes (health), better system performance (care) and better professional development (learning)” (Batalden & Davidoff, 2007, p. 2). To expand on that definition, for example to include public health, and describe how this term has led to a broad movement, we provide a bit of history. What was originally called total quality management (TQM) in the manufacturing industry evolved into CQI as it was applied to health care administrative and clinical processes. Over time, the term continued to evolve, and now the same concepts and activities are referred to as quality improvement or quality management, or even sometimes simply as improvement, as in the Model for Improvement (Langley et al., 2009). Except when we refer to specific historical examples, the terms CQI and QI will be used primarily throughout this text. In health care, a broader definition of CQI and its components is this: CQI is a structured organizational process for involving personnel in planning and executing a continuous flow of improvements to provide quality health care that meets or exceeds expectations. CQI usually involves a common set of characteristics, which include the following: ■ A link to","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_2"}}],["528",{"pageContent":"QI is a structured organizational process for involving personnel in planning and executing a continuous flow of improvements to provide quality health care that meets or exceeds expectations.

Localized improvement efforts 2. Organizational learning 3. Process reengineering 4. Evidence-based practice and manage ment Localized improvement occurs when an ad hoc team is developed to look at a specific process problem or opportunity. Organizational learning occurs when this process is documented and results in the development of policies and procedures, which are then implemented. Examples include the development of protocols, procedures, clinical pathways, and so on. Process reengineering occurs when a major investment blends internal and external resources to make changes, often including the development of information systems, which radically impact key organizational processes. Evidence-based practice and management involve the selection of Defi nitions 3 best health and management practices; these are determined by examination of the professional literature and consideration of internal experience, and more recently, especially in public health, accreditation requirements. The lines of demarcation between these four initiatives are not clear because performance improvement can occur across a continuum of project size, impact, content, external consultant involvement, and departure from existing norms. Societal Learning In recent years, the emphasis on quality has increased at the societal level. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now called the U.S. National Academy of Medicine) has issued a number of reports critical of the quality of care and the variability of both quality and cost across the country (IOM, 2000, 2001). This concern has increased with mounting evidence of the societal cost of poor-quality care in both lives and dollars (Brennan et al., 2004).

It builds on the pioneering work of Phillip Crosby (1979), who provided a focus on the role of cost in quality initiatives that is quite relevant today. Crosby’s writings emphasize developing an estimate of the cost of nonconformance, also called the cost of quality. Developing this estimate involves identifying and assigning values to all of the unnecessary costs associated with waste and wasted effort when work is not done correctly the first time. This includes the costs of identifying errors, correcting them, and making up for the customer dissatisfaction that results. Estimates of the cost of poor quality range from 20–40% of the total costs of the industry, a range widely accepted by hospital administrators and other health care experts. This view leads naturally to a broadening of the definition of quality by introducing the concept of adding value, in addition to ensuring the highest quality of care, implying greater accountability and a cost benefit to enhance the decision-making and evaluation aspects of CQI initiatives. This concept has seen a resurgence in recent years as national health plans, for example in the United States and the United Kingdom, look to minimize cost and increase value while providing the highest quality of care. For example, several leading experts propose refocusing on quality and accountability simultaneously, noting that “improving the U.S. health care system requires simultaneous pursuit of three aims: improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of health care” (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008, p. 759). These same sentiments are echoed by Robert Brook of the RAND Corporation, who proposes that the future of CQI in health care requires a focus on the concept of value, with consideration of both cost and quality (Brook, 2010). Most recently, a large-scale reinforcement of these concepts in the United States is found in the goals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which jointly emphasizes improvements to access, quality of care, and cost reduction. Although some progress can be attributed to the ACA for example, in regard to lowering hospital acquired infections and readmissions— achievement of its long-term goals is still a work in progress ( Blumenthal, Abrams, & Nuzum, 2015; Somander, 2015).

These concepts are discussed in greater detail throughout this book, particularly in the final chapter (Chapter 14). Concerns about linking quality and value are not limited to the United States; similar evidence and concerns have been reported from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (Baker et al., 2004; Davis et al., 2002; Kable, Gibbard, & Spigelman, 2002). This emphasis has played out in studies, commissions, and reports as well as the efforts of regulatory organizations to institutionalize quality through their standards and certification processes. As you will see throughout this book, concern for quality and cost is a matter of public policy. 4 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement Professional Responsibility Health care as a whole is often likened to a cottage industry with overtones of a medieval craft guild, with a bias toward treatment rather than prevention and a monopoly of access to and implementation of technical knowledge. This system reached its zenith in the mid20th century and has been under pressure ever since (McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2002; Rastegar, 2004; Schlesinger, 2002; Starr, 1982). It is reinforced by the concept of professionalism, by which service providers are assumed to have exclusive access to knowledge and competence and, therefore, take full responsibility for self- regulation and for quality. However, much of the public policy debate has centered on the weaknesses of the professional system in improving quality of care. Critics point to excessive professional autonomy; protectionist guild practices, such as secrecy, restricted entry, and scapegoating; lack of capital accumulation for modernization; and economic self-interest as major problems. As we will see, all of these issues impinge on the search for improved quality. However, we cannot ignore the role of professional development as a potential engine of quality improvement, despite the popular emphasis on institutional improvement and societal learning. This, too, will be addressed in subsequent chapters. ▸ Rationale and Distinguishing Characteristics As health care organizations and professions develop their own performance improvement approaches, their management must lead them through a decision process in which activities are initiated, adapted, and then institutionalized.

Organizations embark on CQI for a variety of reasons, including accreditation requirements, cost control, competition for customers, and pressure from employers and payers. Linder (1991), for example, suggests that there are three basic CQI strategies: true process improvement, competitive advantage, and conformance to requirements. Some institutions genuinely desire to maximize their quality of care as defined in both technical and customer preference terms. Others wish simply to increase their share of the local health care market. Still others wish to do whatever is necessary to maintain their accreditation status with bodies such as TJC, National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA), and others, after which they will return to business as usual. As you might imagine, this book is written for the first group—those who truly wish to improve their processes and excel in the competitive health care market by giving their customers the quality care that they deserve. Although CQI comes in a variety of forms and is initiated for a variety of reasons, it does have distinguishing characteristics and functions. These characteristics and functions are often defined as the essence of good management and leadership. They include: (1) understanding and adapting to the external environment; (2) empowering clinicians and managers to analyze and improve processes; (3) adopting a norm that the term customer includes both patients and providers and that customer preferences are important determinants of quality in the process; (4) developing a multidisciplinary approach that goes beyond conventional departmental and professional lines; (5) adopting a planned, articulated philosophy of ongoing change and adaptation; (6) setting up mechanisms to ensure implementation of best practices through planned organizational learning; (7) providing the motivation for a rational, data-based, cooperative approach to process analysis and change; and (8) developing a culture that promotes all of the above (see Chapter 2).

Many health care processes developed and expanded in a complex, political, and authoritarian environment, acquiring the patina of science. The application of data-based management and scientific principles to the clinical and administrative processes that produce patient care is what CQI is all about. Even with all the public concern about medical errors and patient safety, improvement cannot occur without both institutional will and professional leadership ( Millenson, 2003). CQI is simultaneously two things: a management philosophy and a management method. It is distinguished by the recognition that customer requirements are the key to customer quality and that customer requirements ultimately will change over time because of changes in evidence-based practices and associated changes in education, economics, technology, and culture. Such changes, in turn, require continuous improvements in the administrative and clinical methods that affect the quality of patient care and population health. This dynamic between changing expectations and continuous efforts to meet these expectations is captured in the Japanese word kaizen, translated as “continuous improvement” (Imai, 1986). Change is fundamental to the health care environment, and the organization’s systems must have both the will and the way to master such change effectively. Customer Focus The use of the term customer presents a special challenge to many health professionals (Houpt, Gilkey, & Ehringhaus, 2015). For many, it is a term that runs contrary to the professional model of health services and the idea that “the doctor knows best.” Some health professionals would prefer terms that connote the more dependent roles of client or patient. In some cases, it is professional pride about caring for patients and their families that causes disdain for the term customer. In CQI terms, customer is a generic term referring to the end user of a group’s output or product. The customer can be external or internal to the system—a patient, a payer, a colleague, or someone from another department. User satisfaction then becomes one ultimate test of process and product quality. Consequently, new efforts and new resources must be devoted to ascertaining what the customer wants through the use of consumer surveys, focus groups, interviews, and various other ways of gathering information on customer preferences, expectations, and perceived experiences.

The initial assumption is that the process needs to be changed and the persons already involved in that process are needed to help identify how to approach a given problem or opportunity. Therefore, CQI moves beyond the ideas of participative management and decentralized organizations. It is, however, participative in that it encourages the involvement of all personnel associated with a particular work process to provide relevant information and become part of the solution. CQI is also decentralized in that it places responsibility for ownership of each process in the hands of its implementers, those most directly involved with it. Yet this level of participation and decentralization does not absolve management of its fundamental responsibility; in fact, it places additional burdens on management. In situations where the problem is within 6 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement the system (usually the case), management is responsible for change. CQI calls for significant amounts of managerial thought, oversight, flexibility, and responsibility. CQI inherently increases the dignity of the employees involved because it not only recognizes the important role belonging to each member of the process improvement team, but it also involves them as partners and even leaders in the redesign of the process. In some cases, professionals can also serve as consultants to other teams as well as to management. Not surprisingly, organizations using CQI often experience improvements in morale (intrinsic motivation) and higher levels of engagement. When the level of quality is being measured, workers can rightly take pride in the quality of the work they are producing. The importance of motivation and engagement to CQI efforts is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 2. Another important aspect of having a systems focus is the recognition that health care systems are dynamically complex and can include many organizations, both large (macro-) systems and small (micro-) systems (see Chapters 6 and 9). An important part of a systems focus is the understanding that improving quality and safety of complex systems requires systems thinking (see Chapter 2), a management discipline that “acknowledges the large number of parts in a system, the infinite number of ways in","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_8"}}],["534",{"pageContent":"An important part of a systems focus is the understanding that improving quality and safety of complex systems requires systems thinking (see Chapter 2), a management discipline that “acknowledges the large number of parts in a system, the infinite number of ways in which the parts interact and the nature of the interactions” (Spath & Kelly, 2017, p. 44). See Ross (2014) for further description of the components of systems thinking. Measurement and Decision Making Another distinguishing feature of CQI is the rigorous belief in fact-based learning and decision making, captured by Deming’s saying, “In God we trust. All others bring data.” Facts do include perceptions, and decisions cannot all be delayed to await the results of scientifically correct, double-blind studies. However, everyone involved in CQI activities is expected to study the multiple causes of events and to explore a wide array of system-wide solutions. The primary purpose of data and measurement in CQI is learning—how to make system improvements and what the impact of each change that we have already made has had on the overall system. Measurement is not intended to be used for selection, reward, or punishment ( Berwick, 1996). It is surprising and rewarding to see a team move away from the table- pounding “I’m right and you’re stupid” position (with which so many meetings in health care start) by gathering data, both qualitative and quantitative data, to see what is actually happening and why. Multiple causation is assumed, and the search for answers starts with trying to identify the full set of factors contributing to less-thanoptimal system performance. The inherent barriers that accompany CQI implementation include the tension between the professionals’ need for autonomy and control and the objectives of organizational learning and conformance to best practices. Organizations can also oversimplify their environment, as sometimes happens with clinical pathways. Seriously ill patients or patients with multiple chronic conditions do not fit the simple diagnoses often assumed when developing such pathways; a traditional disease- management approach may not suffice, and a broader chronic-care model that incorporates a personalized approach may be necessary (See Chapter 7). There may also be a related tendency to try to over control processes. Health care is not like manufacturing, and it is necessary to understand that patients (anatomy, physiology, psyche, and family setting), providers, and diagnostic categories are highly variable—and that variance reduction can only go so far.

Rationale and Distinguishing Characteristics 7 ▸ Elements of CQI Together with these distinguishing characteristics, CQI in health care is usually composed of a number of elements, including: ■ Philosophical elements, which for the most part mirror the distinguishing characteristics cited previously ■ Structural elements, which are usually associated with both industrial and professional quality improvement programs ■ Health specific elements, which add the specialized knowledge of health care and public health to the generic CQI approach Philosophical Elements The philosophical elements are those aspects of CQI that, at a minimum, must be present in order to constitute a CQI effort. They include: 1. Strategic focus—Emphasis on having a vision/mission, values, and objectives that performance improvement processes are designed, prioritized, and implemented to support 2. Customer focus—Emphasis on both customer (patient, provider, payer) satisfaction and health outcomes as performance measures 3. Systems view—Emphasis on analysis of the whole system providing a service or influencing an outcome and practicing systems thinking 4. Data-driven (evidence-based) analy sis—Emphasis on gathering and using objective data on system operation and system performance 5. Implementer involvement— Emphasis on involving the owners of all components of the system in seeking a common understanding of its delivery process 6. Multiple causation—Emphasis on identifying the multiple root causes of a set of system phenomena 7. Solution identification— Emphasis on seeking a set of solutions that enhance overall system performance through simultaneous improvements in a number of normally independent functions 8. Process optimization—Emphasis on optimizing a delivery process to meet customer needs regardless of existing precedents and on implementing the system changes regardless of existing territories and fiefdoms 9. Continuing improvement—Emphasis on continuing the systems analysis even when a satisfactory solution to the presenting problem is obtained 10.

Organizational learning— Emphasis on organizational learning so that the capacity of the organization to generate process improvement and foster personal growth is enhanced Structural Elements Beyond the philosophical elements just cited, a number of useful structural elements can be used to structure, organize, and support the continuous improvement process. Almost all CQI initiatives make intensive use of these structural elements, which reflect the operational aspects of CQI and include: 1. Process improvement teams— Emphasis on forming and empowering teams of employees to deal with existing problems and opportunities (see Chapter 6) 2. CQI tools—Use of one or more of the CQI tools so frequently cited in the industrial and health- quality literature: flowcharts, checklists, cause-and-effect diagrams, frequency and Pareto charts, run charts, and control charts (see Chapter 4) 8 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement 3. Parallel organization— Development of a separate management structure to set priorities for and monitor CQI strategy and implementation, usually referred to as a quality council 4. Organizational lead ership— Leadership, at the top levels and throughout the organization, to make the process effective and foster its integration into the institutional fabric of the organization (see Chapter 2) 5. Statistical thinking and analysis— Use of statistics, including statistical process control, to identify common vs. special causes of variation in processes and practices (see Chapter 4) 6. Customer satisfaction measures— Understanding the importance of measuring customer satisfaction, but also the strengths and weaknesses of available sources of data and survey methodologies in current use (see Chapter 4) 7.

The application of quality-improvement techniques has reached unprecedented levels throughout the world and especially in health care. What started as a “business solution” to address major weaknesses, including a reputation for poor quality, that Japan faced in its manufacturing after World War II has spread beyond Evolution of the Quality Movement 9 manufacturing to encompass both products and services. This proliferation includes multiple industries across the world and, most notably, all sectors of health care. W. Edwards Deming described what happened in Japan as a “miracle that started off with a concussion in 1950.” This miracle was the beginning of an evolutionary process whereby the Japanese military was transformed after the war and given a new goal: the reconstruction of Japan. As a result, “Japanese quality and dependability turned upward in 1950 and by 1954 had captured markets the world over” ( Deming, 1986, p. 486). Built upon the expertise of Japanese leaders from industry, science, and the military, and with the guidance of Deming, using his own ideas and those of his colleague, Walter Shewhart, this miracle would transform industry not only in Japan, but also in many other countries around the world. Although Deming and Shewhart both had been advocating a statistical approach to quality for some time, the Japanese were the first to implement these ideas widely","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_12"}}],["538",{"pageContent":"this miracle would transform industry not only in Japan, but also in many other countries around the world. Although Deming and Shewhart both had been advocating a statistical approach to quality for some time, the Japanese were the first to implement these ideas widely. In Japan, the use of these techniques quickly spread to both product and service organizations. Outside Japan, despite slow adoption at first, this movement spread to the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. But its largescale adoption did not occur until the 1980s in manufacturing, most notably due to competition from the Japanese automobile industry. In fact, the U.S. industry was perceived to be in a state of crisis when these methods began to receive wider acceptance. As Deming surmised, this crisis was due to poor quality that could be traced primarily to the incorrect belief that quality and productivity were incompatible. Deming demonstrated the fallacy of this notion in his landmark book, Out of the Crisis, first published in 1982 (Deming, 1986), thus forming the basis of what is now known as continuous quality improvement. From this foundation, CQI has evolved exponentially—over time, across the world, and from industrial manufacturing to the provision of services. The beginning of the quality revolution occurred in America in 1980, when Deming was featured on an NBC television documentary, “If Japan Can, Why Can’t We?” and a later PBS program, “Quality or Else,” both of which had a major impact on bringing quality issues into the U.S. public’s awareness (AmStat News, 1993). Over many years, Deming made enormous contributions to the development of CQI, but he is perhaps best known for the 14-point program of recommendations that he devised for management to improve quality (see BOX 1.1). His focus was always on processes (rather than organizational structures), on the evercontinuous cycle of improvement, and on the rigorous statistical analysis of objective data. Deming believed that management has the final responsibility for quality because employees work in the system and management deals with the system itself. He also felt that most quality problems are management-controlled rather than worker-controlled. These beliefs were the basis for his requirement that CQI be based on an organization-wide commitment, including the important role and example of senior leaders.

The quality evolution later crossed fields as diverse as computer science, education, and health care—and within health care, it has evolved to encompass multiple levels and segments of health care delivery. As discussed earlier, this evolution has taken many forms and names over the years, encompassing and subsuming quality control, quality assurance, quality management, and quality improvement. Like the field itself, its name has evolved from total quality management (TQM) to continuous quality improvement (CQI), or simply quality improvement (QI). From TQM to CQI The evolution from TQM to CQI was more than a simple change in terminology; it represents a fundamental change in how organizations have come to recognize the importance of ensuring that changes are improvements 10 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement and that the improvement processes are ongoing, requiring learning and involvement in the process at all levels, from the individual to the organization level. CQI has been directly linked to management and leadership competencies and philosophies that embrace change and innovation as the keys to a vision of value-driven growth. The fundamentals of TQM are based on the scientific management movement developed in the early 20th century. Emphasis was given to “management based on facts,” but with management assumed to be the master of the facts. It was believed to be the responsibility of management to specify one correct method of work for all workers and to see that personnel executed that method to ensure quality. Gradually, that perspective has been influenced by the human relations perspective and by the recognition of the importance and ability of the people in the organization. FIGURE 1.1 illustrates the wide range of leaders who were involved in the quality evolution, with an emphasis on health care. Some of the most notable contemporaries of Deming and Shewhart who were major contributors to the history of TQM, and later CQI, include Armand Feigenbaum, Joseph Juran, and Philip Crosby. Their contributions have been widely documented in the literature, as well as through organizations that continue to promote their ideas, such as the Juran Institute.

Along with other Japanese quality engineers, Ishikawa also refined the application of the foundations of CQI and added the concepts described in BOX 1.2. Cross-Disciplinary Thinking More than a historical business trend or a movement, the growth of quality improvement represents an evolution of both the philosophies and processes that have been studied and improved over the years, through application, review, feedback, and then broader application. There has been a fair amount of scrutiny, and these approaches have not only stood the test of time but have evolved to address criticisms and have been adapted to meet specialized needs that are unique in some segments, especially in health care. This phenomenon has occurred naturally as a result of cross-disciplinary strategic thinking processes, where learning occurs by focusing not on what makes industries and disciplines different from each other, but rather on what they share in common (Brown, 1999). A good example of this commonality is a focus on adding value to products and services for customers, be they automobile buyers, airline passengers, or hospital patients. This notion can be directly extended to quality improvement (see FIGURE 1.2) by noting that industries— for example, automobile manufacturing vs. health care—may differ in terms of specific mission, goals, and outcomes but may share strategies to add value, including the philosophy, process, and tools of CQI. As a result, the common strategic elements of CQI have been adopted from diverse industrial applications and then customized to meet the special needs of health care.

A comparison of quality from an industrial perspective vs. quality from a health care perspective reveals that the two are surprisingly similar and that both have strengths and weaknesses (Donabedian, 1993). The industrial model is limited in that it (1) does not address the complexities, including the dynamic character and professional and cultural norms, of the patient–practitioner relationship; (2) downplays the knowledge, skills, motivation, and legal/ethical obligations of the practitioner; (3) treats quality as free, ignoring quality–cost trade-offs; (4) gives more attention to supportive activities and less to clinical ones; and (5) provides less emphasis on influencing professional performance via “education, retraining, supervision, encouragement, and censure” (Donabedian, 1993, pp. 1–4). On the other hand, Donabedian suggested that the professional health care model can learn the following from the industrial model: 1. New appreciation of the fundamental soundness of health care quality traditions 2. The need for even greater attention to consumer requirements, values, and expectations 3. The need for greater attention to the design of systems and processes as a means of quality assurance 4. The need to extend the selfmonitoring, self-governing tradition of physicians to others in the organization","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_19"}}],["545",{"pageContent":", values, and expectations 3.

The need to extend the selfmonitoring, self-governing tradition of physicians to others in the organization 5. The need for a greater role by management in assuring the quality of clinical care 6. The need to develop appropriate applications of statistical control methods to health care monitoring 7. The need for greater education and training in quality monitoring and assurance for all concerned (1993, pp. 1–4) In reality, there is a continuum of CQI activities, with manufacturing at one end of the continuum and professional services at the other (Hart, 1993). The CQI approach should be modified in accordance with its position along this continuum. Manufacturing processes have linear flows, repetitive cycle steps, standardized inputs, high analyzability, and low worker discretion. Professional services, on the other hand, involve multiple nonstandardized and variable inputs, nonrepetitive operations, unpredictable demand peaks, and high worker discretion. Many organizations, including health care organizations, have processes at different points along that continuum that should be analyzed accordingly. The hospital, for example, has laboratory and support operations that are like a factory and has preventive, diagnostic, and treatment activities that are professional services. The objective of factory-like operations is to drive out variability to conform to requirements and to produce near-zero defects. At the other end, the objectives of disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are to do whatever it takes to produce improved health and satisfaction and maintain the loyalty of customers— including both patients (external customers) and employees (internal customers). An important contrast between traditional industry and health care is evidence of the pace of quality improvement initiatives in health care relative to the traditional industries that spawned CQI methods globally. As described by a former director of the McKinsey Global Institute, William Lewis, “For most industry the benefits from the various quality movements have been quite large but … they are also largely in the past” with only incremental progress now being made, and he contrasts that development with health care, which is the “big exception” (Leonhardt, 2009, p. 11).

So while 14 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement health care has learned from manufacturing and commercial industry, its evolution in CQI has led to acceleration in comparison to the slowdown, and even reversal, seen in manufacturing and commercial industry; for example, consider the quality issues faced in 2010 by Toyota—a manufacturing pioneer from which some of these approaches have evolved ( Crawley, 2010; Dawson & Takahashi, 2011). (It should be noted that reports in the commercial media in recent years indicate that these issues have been resolved by a return to best practices and greater customer focus [Rechtin, 2014].) This evolution, or cross-disciplinary translation, continues within a variety of health care settings, as will be illustrated throughout this text, with some tools and techniques being especially good examples of cross disciplinary adoption. Probably the best example is the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle originally developed by Shewhart (1931) for industry. (Although the PDSA cycle is often attributed to Deming, he attributes it to Shewhart [ Deming, 1986].) It is especially amenable to widespread use in health care and continues to find new applications to meet an ever-widening range of clinical and programmatic problems (see FIGURE 1.3). One very interesting example of the cross-disciplinary/industry phenomenon, which has been given much attention both in scientific journals and in popular media, is the adoption of surgical checklists to prevent errors. The checklist is a very simple but powerful project management and safety tool that has been used in various industries, but it is probably most well known for its effectiveness in the airline industry. A strong case has been made in scientific publications and in the popular media for greater adoption of checklists in surgery (Haynes et al., 2009) and other medical specialties (Gawande, 2009; Pronovost et al., 2006). Although its adoption in a wide range of settings has been seen in recent years, the effectiveness of this tool, used by itself, has been questioned by some (Bosk et al., 2009) and studied by many, with the goal of better understanding its role and improving its effectiveness (Avelling, McCulloch, & Dixon-Woods, 2013; de Vries et al., 2010; Wandersman et","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_21"}}],["547",{"pageContent":"9) and studied by many, with the goal of better understanding its role and improving its effectiveness (Avelling, McCulloch, & Dixon-Woods, 2013; de Vries et al., 2010; Wandersman et al., 2016). The use of checklists also provides a good illustration of some basic CQI principles that have broader implications. For example, checklist usage raises two key questions that are important in regard to a variety of CQI applications: (1) how much does the effectiveness of using checklists vary for different health care applications and settings? and (2) what is their specific role in improving health care safety and quality? One brief answer to these questions is that while the checklist is a simple tool, it is not a magic bullet—instead, it can be an effective means for helping ensure the application of other CQI principles in an overall Evolution of the Quality Movement 15 Do: Carry out the change or test, preferably on a small scale.

For example, its use and effectiveness (or lack thereof) has broad implications about how health care teams communicate and share responsibilities; how leadership supports innovations and change—ultimately a cultural issue; and how to monitor and ensure compliance with CQI initiatives (Avelling, McCulloch, & Dixon-Woods, 2013; DixonWoods & Martin, 2016). Checklists provide an example of the importance of teamwork in CQI (see Chapter 6) and provide an example of a CQI tool (in Chapter 4) as well as an example of the broader issue of culture, leadership, and diffusion of CQI in health care (in Chapter 2).

Checklists are also used as an example of the use of social marketing to increase compliance with CQI innovations and tools (in Chapter 8). New approaches, refinements of older concepts, and different combinations of ideas are occurring almost daily in this ongoing evolutionary process. As more and more organizations adopt CQI, we are seeing increasing innovation and experimentation with CQI thinking and its applications. This is especially true of the health care arena, where virtually every organization has had to work hard to develop its own adaptation of CQI to the clinical process. The Evolution Across Sectors of Health Care The evolution in health care—which started in the most well-defined sector, hospitals—now includes all segments of the health care system and has become woven into the education of future practitioners, including not only administrators and physicians but also nurses, public health practitioners, and a wide array of other health professionals. It has spanned health care systems in many industrialized nations and now has become a way of meeting emerging crises, with widespread global health applications in resource-poor nations (see Chapter 13). As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the health care evolution of CQI may be traced back to the work of Florence Nightingale, who pioneered the use of statistical methods to analyze variation and propose areas for improvement. As one of many quality improvement initiatives, Florence Nightingale used descriptive statistics to demonstrate the link between unsanitary conditions and needless deaths during the Crimean War (Cohen, 1984). The evolutionary context of quality in health care, described in Figure 1.1, has occurred at many different levels, spanning history and geography, and has included a broadening of applications and a sharpening of tools and techniques. Both within and outside health care, probably the most dramatic part of this evolution has been the wide dispersion of knowledge about how to use these techniques, first starting with a small group of expert consultants and later expanding to a broad range of practitioners with a common goal to make improvements in a diverse set of products and services. Coupled with that “practice” goal have been educational efforts to develop and disseminate qualityimprovement competencies by teaching these methods to an ever-widening range of health care professionals. For example, these efforts have included recent initiatives in nursing, the primary profession of Florence Nightingale (Sherwood & Jones, 201","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_23"}}],["549",{"pageContent":"qualityimprovement competencies by teaching these methods to an ever-widening range of health care professionals. For example, these efforts have included recent initiatives in nursing, the primary profession of Florence Nightingale (Sherwood & Jones, 2013). In parallel with this broadening health care evolution over time and space, the same improvement processes were being applied to CQI tools and techniques, leading to improvements and greater precision relative to the measurement of outcomes and processes. The improvement processes also spawned international private- and public-sector organizations, which can be thought of as “health care quality czars,” that have applied and expanded these approaches. These organizations include the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and both national and international regulatory agencies, such as the CMS in the United States, which, with the establishment of Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), uses data from the Medicare and Medicaid system to monitor quality of care and, more 16 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement importantly, to define improvement strategies (Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013). Similarly, local, national, and international accreditation agencies, such as TJC in the United States and its global counterparts (e.g., Joint Commission International [JCI]), have mandated the need for quality improvement in large health care systems (see Chapter 12). Ultimately, this has led to the emergence of quality leaders, with recognized achievements via a health care organization’s eligibility to receive awards such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (Hertz, Reimann, & Bostwick, 1994; McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006). Around the mid-1980s, CQI was applied in several health care settings. Most notable was the early work done by three physicians following the principles outlined by Deming: Paul Batalden at Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), Donald Berwick at Harvard Community Health Center and IHI, and Brent James at Intermountain Health Care. Examples of their work and ideas will be illustrated throughout this chapter and this book. Armed with the ideas of these creative quality leaders who elaborated on techniques, such as the PDSA cycle that were drawn originally from the pioneers of quality improvement, an acceleration marked by more widespread applications has occurred throughout all sectors of health care in the 21st century.

Virtually all those concerns about cost and benefits and professional autonomy seemed swamped by the documentation of unacceptably high rates of medical errors. The recognition that needless human suffering, loss of life, and wasted resources were related to unnecessary variability in treatment and the lack of implementation of known best practices galvanized professional groups, regulators, and payers into action. Suddenly, quality improvement was acknowledged to be a professional responsibility, a quality-of-care issue rather than a managerial tactic. Current investment and involvement levels are high as evidence has mounted that the variability in clinical processes and the lack of conformance to evidence-based best practices has cost the public dearly. Many of the actors identified previously are demanding accountability for patient safety and for achieving acceptable levels of clinical performance and outcomes achievement. Adverse events are now undergoing extreme scrutiny, and a broad range of quality indicators are being reported, followed, and compared by payers and regulators (see Chapter 10). One important change that called even greater attention to the seriousness of medical errors was that, effective October 1, 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) adopted a nonreimbursement policy for certain “never events,” which are defined as serious, preventable hospital-acquired conditions. The rationale is that hospitals cannot bill CMS for adverse events and complications that are considered never events because they are preventable; the goal is to motivate hospitals to accelerate improvement of patient safety. A list of never events can be found at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) website, and a summary of how this step came about is offered by Michaels et al. (2007). Local and regional variability in health care has long been known to exist, but the translation of that variability into missed opportunities for improved outcomes has been slow in coming.

For a while, financial questions seemed to have dissipated as the social costs took precedence. However, these cost issues have certainly been revisited and have grown in importance with the full implementation of the ACA in the United States and other health care reform initiatives in other locations around the world. Concerns about cost of care continue and need to be considered relative to CQI initiatives and the overall nature of the relationship of cost to quality and the role of value. ▸ From Industrialization to Personalization Quality has been and continues to be a central issue in health care organizations and among health care providers. The classic works of Avedis Donabedian, Robert Brook, and Leonard Rosenfeld, to name a few, have made major contributions to the definition, measurement, and understanding of health care quality. However, the corporatization of health care in the United States (Starr, 1982) and other changes to the health care system have redefined, and will continue to redefine, how we manage quality. Given the increasing proportion of the gross national product allocated to health services and the redefinition of health care as an “economic good,” health care organizations are influenced to a growing extent by organizations in the industrial sector. As part of this process, health care organizations have become “corporations,” with expansion goals to create larger hospital systems. The long-held perception of health care as a cottage industry persisted into the 1960s and 1970s. In this view, health care was seen as a craft or art delivered by individual professionals who had learned by apprenticeship and who worked independently in a decentralized system. These practitioners tailored their craft to each individual situation using processes that were neither recorded nor explicitly engineered, and they were personally accountable for the performance and financial outcomes of the care they provided. The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a distinct change, which is often described as the “industrialization of health care” (Kongstvedt, 1997).

This change affected almost all aspects of health care delivery, influencing how risks are allocated, how care is organized, and how professionals are motivated and incentivized. This industrialization process can be described utilizing the dynamic stability model of Boynton, Victor, and Pine (1993), which presents various industrial transformation strategies. These can be adapted to health care services to describe the transformation from craft to a more industrialized approach. For example, one strategy follows the traditional route of industrialization utilizing mass production to ensure high levels of process stability, as illustrated by the bundling of unique medical procedures into a few high-volume, specialized centers. However, most health care activities have followed an alternate route that is also described by this model, bypassing mass production due to the high variability in patient needs and using techniques of CQI and process reengineering. The Victor & Boynton (1998) model for the organization suggests an appropriate path for organizational development and improvement. As presented in FIGURE 1.4, health care processes and product lines have begun to move from the craft stage to positions in all of the other three stages of that model. Each of the four stages requires its own approach to quality. 1. Craft requires that the individual improve with experience and use the tacit knowledge produced to develop a better individual reputation and group reputation. Craft activities can be leveraged to a limited extent by a community of cooperating and teaching crafts-persons. 18 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement 2. Mass production requires the discipline that produces conformance quality in high volume at low cost. Critics sometimes refer to this approach using terms such as industrialization or the deskilling of the profession and occasionally mention Henry Ford’s assembly lines as a negative model. 3. Process enhancement requires that processes be analyzed and modified to develop a best-practice approach using worker feedback and process-owning teams within the organization. 4. Mass customization requires that the organization takes that best practice, modularizes and supports it independently, and then uses those modules to build efficient, low-cost processes that are responsive to individual customer wants and needs.

The learning system we describe along the right path requires that managers leverage the learning from previous forms of work. … If managers attempt to transform without understanding the learning taking place …, then transformation efforts will be at best slightly off the mark and at worst futile. In addition, if managers misunderstand what type of work (craft, mass production, process enhancement, or mass customization) is taking place in a given process or activity when transformation starts, then they may use the wrong transformation steps ( development, linking, modularization, or renewal). These authors, however, were referring to a single, commercial firm with a relatively limited line of goods and services. In health care, a single organization such as a hospital might contain examples of multiple stages due to the variety of its products. There is a recognition that complexity is ever-increasing; for example, one hears complaints that some traditional definitions apply to patients with only one diagnosis, whereas most very sick patients, especially the elderly, have multiple diagnoses. Therefore, the prevailing quality and performance enhancement systems have to be prepared with much greater levels of variability—in patient problem constellations, anatomy, physiology, and preferences, as well as in provider potentials and preferences (McLaughlin, 1996).

Furthermore, increased availability of genetic information will further fractionate many disease categories, making the definitions of disease even more complex. Among other ideas, this has led to the concept of personalization of medicine and an associated concept, individualization of care, which will be discussed in greater detail in the next section. FIGURE 1.5 suggests how this has and will occur in health care. As scientific information about a health care process accumulates, it shifts from the craft stage to the process enhancement stage.

If there is still too much art or lack of science to justify codification, the enhanced process can be returned to the craft mode or moved into the mass customization and co-configuration pathway. The craft mode contains multiple delivery alternatives. For example, if someone were to decide to commission an artist to make a custom work of art, that person has two ways to specify how it is to be controlled. The first is to say, “You are the artist. Do your thing, and I will pay whatever it costs.” This is fee-forservice indemnity. The other is to say, “You can decide what to do, but here is all that I can afford to pay.” This is capitation. In both cases, the grand design and the execution are still in the hands of the artist. However, that does not preclude the artist from learning by doing, obtaining suggestions from vendors of materials and equipment, or observing and collaborating with colleagues. Neither the artist nor the person commissioning the art commits to a single “best” way to do things, because neither is able to articulate or agree on the best way to reach the desired outcome.

The mass-customization pathway has long been thought of as the best way to produce satisfied health care customers at low or reasonable relative costs. The organization develops a series of modular approaches to prevention and treatment, highly articulated and well supported by information technology, so that they can be deployed efficiently in a variety of places and configurations to respond to customer needs. Clinical pathways represent one example of modularization. They represent best practices as known to the organization, and they are applied and configured by a configuror (the health care professional) to meet the needs of the individual patient. This requires an integrated information system that will give the health care professional, usually a generalist, access to specialized information and to full information about the patient’s background, medical history, and status; the system will also allow the health care professional to synchronize the implementation of the modules of service being delivered. In a sense, mass customization represents a process that simulates craft but is highly science based, coordinated, integrated with other process flows, and efficient. How does this differ from the well-run modern hospital or clinic? As described by Victor & Boynton (1998, pp. 12–13): The tightly linked process steps developed under process enhancement are now exploded, not into isolated parts, but into a dynamic web of interconnected modular units. Rather than the sequential assembly lines, … work is now organized as a complex, reconfigurable product and service system. Modularization breaks up the work into units that are interchangeable on demand from the customer. And everything has to happen fast. … Modularization transforms work by creating a dynamic, robust network of units. Within some of these units, … there may still be active craft, mass production, or process enhancement work taking place, but all the possible interfaces among modules must be carefully designed so that they can rapidly, efficiently, and seamlessly regroup to meet customer needs. Where does science come in? Victor and Boynton refer to architectural knowledge, a much deeper process understanding than that needed for earlier stages of their model. Also at a practical level, it takes hard science to legitimize the conformance by providers required to make such a system work. The remaining stage of this model has been called “co-configuration”—a system in which the customer is linked into the network, and customer intelligence is accessed as readily as the providers’ knowledge.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_30"}}],["556",{"pageContent":"formance by providers required to make such a system work.

In a futuristic sense, From Industrialization to Personalization 21 one should also be able to include the patient in the decision-making network to a high degree. The future has arrived in the form of what many authors call “mass personalization.” It represents an even more intense involvement of customers in product and service delivery choices; in health care, patient-specific needs and wants are being more directly addressed. Mass Personalization Personalization is an evolutionary concept that is not only having an impact on how industries deliver products and services but also on how organizations are structured, such as in learning organizations. It is an example of a business application that continues to evolve within the business world and is now beginning to evolve at its own pace within health care. In business, this evolution is especially apparent in service industries, where the morphing of mass customization into mass personalization has been fueled by the rapid growth of technology, especially the Internet, search engines, and personal media, to bring each customer’s wants and needs in direct contact with service providers. This phase of evolution has happened quite rapidly, and its speed of growth is directly correlated with technological advances. “Two decades after its conception there is growing evidence that mass customization strategy is transforming into a mass personalization strategy” (Kumar, 2007, p. 533). It was not until 1987 that the term mass customization was first introduced; however, from 1987 to 2008, more than 1,100 articles on mass customization appeared in scholarly journals, with exponential growth in the 1990s (Kumar, 2007). Personalization of products began in the 1950s, with affordability being the key component that led to its popularity and growth. As computer technologies have become more personalized, the concepts of mass customization and co-configuration have evolved into personalization, at an accelerated pace. As Kumar explains, “Mass personalization strategy evolved from mass customization strategy as a result of strides in information and operational technologies” (2007, p. 536). Both strategies are in current use; while similar, they do have differences. As described by Tseng & Piller (2003, p. 7), who have written extensively on this trend:","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_31"}}],["557",{"pageContent":"” (2007, p. 536). Both strategies are in current use; while similar, they do have differences. As described by Tseng & Piller (2003, p. 7), who have written extensively on this trend: Personalization must not be mixed up with customization. While customiza - tion relates to changing, assemb ling, or modifying product or service com ponents according to customers’ needs and desires, personalization involves intense communication and interaction between two parties, namely customer and supplier. Personalization in general is about selecting or filtering information objects for an individual by using information about that individual (the customer profile) and then negotiating the selection with the individual. … From a technical point of view, automatic personalization or recommendation means matching meta-information of products or information objects against meta- information of customers (stored in the customer profile). This leads to strategies that are directed at what Kumar calls “a market of one” (Kumar, 2007, p. 533). Health Care Applications of Personalization That mass personalization is directly applicable to CQI is quite obvious due to their common focus on adding value and customer satisfaction and their common reliance on data and technology. What is a bit surprising is that personalization can be applied directly to CQI in health care, and how rapidly this 22 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement stage of evolution from business to health care is occurring. This concept is closely related to what Berwick calls “patient-centeredness,” a consumerist view of quality of care, which he describes as involving “disruptive shifts in control and power out of the hands of those who give care and into the hands of those who receive it” (Berwick, 2009, p. 555). At first glance, the importance and reliance on evidence-based practice as part of CQI in health care might seem contradictory to personalization; however, as noted by Sackett and many others, the steps in applying evidence-based practice include evaluating the best data available but also using individual clinical judgment and patient input, including patient preferences, in making final treatment decisions (Sackett, 1996; Satterfield et al., 2009).

The current definition of health care personalization encompasses the concepts of individualized care and shared decision making, in addition to personalized medicine (Barratt, 2008; Pfaff et al., 2010; Robinson, Callister, Berry, & Dearing, 2008). In all forms, these concepts lead to greater focus on patient characteristics, needs, and preferences in decision making about their care, and they are all closely associated with the customer focus concepts that are central to CQI. With greater availability of information, via the Internet and other more traditional sources, patients and their families are playing a greater role in health care decision making and quality of care. Sources of data and information abound in numerous easily accessible formats. For example, for many years the AHRQ has provided information to encourage patient participation in their medical care and the quality of the medical care they receive; one example is the AHRQ website “Questions to Ask Your Doctor” (AHRQ, 2012). Similar resources have long been provided by other organizations to support patients with specialty needs; for example, the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Information Service was established in 1975 to help cancer patients find information and treatment resources (NCI n.d.). What has contributed notably to the use of such information is that patients now have greater knowledge and access to technology, such as search engines to find medical information. This has led to input by patients and their families in their own health care decisions and in the quality of their care, which is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7. But the growth in health care personalization goes beyond patients having access to medical information; it relates directly to medical strategies and emerging science for providing higher quality, safer, more personalized treatments. This trend draws strength from a vision of personalized medicine primarily in terms of genomic medicine; it is a means of “focusing on the best ways to develop new therapies and optimize prescribing by steering patients to the right drug at the right dose at the right time” (Hamburg & Collins, 2010, p. 301). This vision includes partnerships among industry, academia, doctors, patients, and the public that will lead to a “national highway for personalized medicine.” One of the earliest signs of success relates to identifying the optimal dosage and combination of treatments for cancer patients (Spector & Blackwell, 2009).

As in the business community, the personalization concept in health care has evolved to include broader components of health care, in part because of advances in research and technology. In medical care, this includes recent breakthroughs in genomics (Spector & Blackwell, 2009) but also tools provided by computer technology, including greater use of electronic medical records. Individualized treatment strategies are further extensions of these concepts, going beyond genomics to include patients’ preferences and experiences in shared decision making with their providers, allowing greater patient participation in choice of drugs and dosages and administration; even more broadly, individualization leads to patients being more proactive in regard to prevention, screening, and early From Industrialization to Personalization 23 treatment, through greater use of information technology, electronic medical records, and decision-making tools, such as patient decision support technologies (Pfaff et al., 2010). Health care personalization can be thought of more broadly as an extension of Wagner’s (1996) chronic care model, which focuses on the individual rather than the condition. This approach is especially useful when individuals have multiple chronic conditions. The evolutionary path of CQI within health care is an important catalyst to personalization that is reflective of broader societal trends spanning a wide range of businesses. These trends are reflected in the concept of customer relationship management (CRM). As described by Kumar (2007), “CRM is the philosophy, policy, and coordinating strategy connecting different players within an organization so as to coordinate their efforts in creating an overall valuable series of experiences, products, and services for the customer.” Kumar notes that CRM also requires that the customer be integrated into all aspects of product and process design and that “customer driven innovation has become a key source of strategic advantage.” This relates not only to health care personalization but also to the traditional focus on customers in CQI and on methods of gathering customer feedback. This is reflected in many ways including the greater use (and some abuse) of patient satisfaction surveys as a way of evaluating quality of care (see Chapter 4).

The greater amount of information available and the increased role of “untrained” patients and their families in care decisions present the challenge of knowing how to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of treatment options. This has led to some level of conflict as the two extremes of standardization vs. personalization strain the boundaries and definitions of evidence-based medicine, with both extremes striving to achieve the highest quality of care. There is an ongoing broad discussion throughout health care, locally and globally, about how to balance these concepts (Pfaff et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2008; Satterfield et al., 2009; Wandersman et al., 2016). What is clear is that these patientcentered concepts are here to stay and will lead to the next stages of the evolution in health care and, as with the previous stages, will continue to grow exponentially. Likewise, referring back to Berwick’s (2009) notion of “patient-centeredness,” patients are playing—and should play—a greater role in health care quality improvement. These patient-centered trends have had an impact on quality improvement education for health care professionals. For example, they are being incorporated into nursing education (Sherwood & Jones, 2013). Day and Smith (2007, pp. 139–140) describe this need: Unfortunately there is wide variation in the quality of information provided by websites and no search engine screens for quality or accuracy. An important part of basic nursing education is helping students develop skills that enable them to evaluate web-based information, especially if that information is going to be passed on to a patient or family member or used as the basis for patient and family teaching. Thus, as with other evolutionary stages in CQI, new challenges to quality management present themselves and will hopefully lead to new opportunities in an unending cycle of improvement. ▸ The Scientific Method of CQI As CQI philosophies and processes have evolved within health care, a series of broadbased approaches have evolved and proven to be widely applicable across a range of health 24 Chapter 1 The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement care settings.

At the foundation of these is the scientific method and the historically proven PDSA cycle, which has been particularly successful in health care as frameworks within which a variety of improvement methods have been applied to measure and further initiate improvement strategies. Walter Shewhart at Bell Laboratories, was the first to introduce the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle, which was presented earlier in Figure 1.3. It should also be noted that over time, the abbreviation PDSA was changed by some to PDCA, the “S” for study being changed to “C” for check, as in checking what impact an improvement has made on the process being changed. Today the terms are used interchangeably, as we will do throughout this book. Either way, Shewhart’s concept has become a very powerful and frequently used quality improvement methodology that has withstood the test of time. Stated quite simply, PDSA cycles “provide a structure for iterative testing of changes to improve quality of systems. … The pragmatic principles of PDSA cycles promote the use of a small scale iterative approach to test interventions, as this enables rapid assessment and provides flexibility to adapt the change according to feedback to ensure fit-for-purpose solutions are developed” (Taylor et al., 2014, pp. 290–291). The key features of any PDSA application are: 1. The use of repeated iterative cycles 2. Prediction-based test of change (developed in the plan stage) 3. Small-scale testing (build as confidence grows—adapting according to feedback and learning) 4. Use of data over time (to understand the impact of change) 5. Documentation (to support local learning and transferability to other settings) (Taylor et al., 2014, p. 293) The two very successful and well-known applications of the PDCA/PDSA cycle that have evolved in health care are HCA’s FOCUS– PDCA model (Batalden & Stoltz, 1993) and the Model for Improvement (Langley et al., 2009). These encompass two frameworks that have been developed to use in conjunction with PDCA/PDSA cycles.

The broad applicability of the PDSA cycle in health care can be traced directly to its roots as it was applied by Deming. One of Deming’s (1993) major premises was that management needs to undergo a transformation. In order to respond successfully to challenges to organizations and their environments, the way to accomplish that transformation, which must be deliberately learned and incorporated into management, is by pursuing what he called “profound knowledge.” The key elements of his system of profound knowledge are (1) appreciation for a system, (2) knowledge about variation, (3) theory of knowledge, and (4) psychology. The Deming process is especially useful in health care because professionals already have knowledge of the subject matter as well as a set of values and disciplines that fit the Deming philosophy. Training in Deming methods adds knowledge of how to build a new theory using insights about systems, variation, and psychology, and it focuses on the answers given to the set of basic questions that center around knowing what is to be accomplished. Furthermore, it applies a cyclical process of testing and learning from data whether the change being made is an improvement and what improvements are needed in the future (Batalden & Stoltz, 1993). A Deming approach, as adopted by the HCA in Nashville, Tennessee, is illustrated in FIGURE 1.6.

(2009). It includes a PDSA cycle as its core approach, returning to the traditional “S,” emphasizing the importance of studying what has been accomplished before making further changes (FIGURE 1.7). Careful study and reflection are points of emphasis made by Berwick (1996), who describes this model as “inductive learning—the growth of knowledge through making changes and then reflecting on the consequences of those changes.” Central to the Model for Improvement are three key questions: 1. What are we trying to accomplish? 2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? 3. What change can we make that will result in an improvement? The wide use of these approaches is due directly to the elegance and simplicity of the PDSA cycle. Likewise, the range of applications ties directly to the generalizability of the PDSA cycle. Recent applications have included public health (see Chapter 11), health care in resourcepoor countries (see Chapter 13) and traditional medical care in industrialized settings, which are described throughout this book. However, with the widespread use of PDSA, there have been some questions raised about how to assess validity and generalizability of specific applications before their results are transferred into clinical practice as new evidence-based methods (Speroff, James, Nelson, Headrick, & Brommels, 2004). These questions fall under the broad heading of how to apply critical appraisal criteria to PDSA, and other CQI initiatives, in a manner that is similar to appraisal of","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 1 - The Global Evolution of Continuous Quality Improvement - From Japanese Manufacturing to Global Health Services_38"}}],["564",{"pageContent":"James, Nelson, Headrick, & Brommels, 2004). These questions fall under the broad heading of how to apply critical appraisal criteria to PDSA, and other CQI initiatives, in a manner that is similar to appraisal of clinical research studies that are directed at efficacy and safety of new treatments or drugs. One approach to addressing these questions is to carefully review how well the key features of the PDSA methods (listed above) have been applied in a specific application; this approach is outlined by Taylor et al. (2014). Included in this approach is Berwick’s emphasis on careful study of findings at the “S” stage of each cycle, before acting on those findings (Berwick, 1996). A useful set of guidelines for strengthening PDSA applications as well as other CQI initiatives, and which parallel the recommendations of Taylor et al. (2014), are presented by Speroff et al. (2004, p. 36) and start with four core questions: 1. Is the quality improvement study pertinent and relevant? 2. Are the results valid? 3. Are appropriate criteria used to interpret the results? 4. Will the study help you with your practice or organization of care? These authors also present detailed recommendations for how to address each of these The Scientifi c Method of CQI 27 What are we trying to accomplish?

Because of the simplicity and consequently the broad usage of PDSA, careful attention should be paid to the guidelines described above in order to ensure proper use and both internal and external validity of applications of the PDSA methodology. Similar discussions have also been carried out recently in regard to improving the applicability of other well known CQI methods and specific results.

Similar discussions have also been carried out recently in regard to improving the applicability of other well known CQI methods and specific results. Recommendations have been presented for greater emphasis on the fidelity of the applications and fuller understanstanding, and consideration of the context, in which project-specific results are obtained before broadly assuming the robustness of their findings. These recommendations help to explain why some CQI methods are not achieving the results that are expected and should be carried out before generalizing them to other settings, and we should always be cautious to not assume that a “magic bullet” has been found that will produce improvements in any situation, regardless of context ( Dixon-Woods & Martin, 2016). ▸ Conclusions The examples of how CQI has evolved in an exponential manner, especially since the advent of the new millennium, are many and varied. Whether this trend is due to greater customer awareness and demands, technology improvements, greater competition, or a combination of these factors, what is clear is that the trend is continuing on a global scale. While some traditional industries that had incorporated CQI are now “making only incremental progress” (Leonhardt, 2009) CQI in health care is leaping forward, using examples and lessons from outside as well as inside health care. National developments (e.g., the ACA in the United States) and international developments (e.g., applications of CQI in resource-poor nations) have been both the result of and the source of global learning. This cycle of learning has led to innovations and paradigm shifts that will ensure further evolution in the future. The institutionalization of CQI in public health, which represents an extension of what has been learned in medical and hospital care, continues to grow due to various influences that mirror other health care sectors, such as national and local accreditation efforts. The examples in this text of how CQI has spread and evolved are by no means exhaustive; improvements will continue to evolve at a pace that is difficult to capture in any snapshot in time. But the patterns of change that are described in this text provide a strong basis for future health improvement models and the challenges that come with these future models, as they address the questions of quality and cost and the issues of “value-added” care, leading to further learning and innovation to meet customer needs and improved health outcomes across the globe.

Sollecito and Julie K. Johnson Change is not merely necessary to life — it is life. —Alvin Toffler (Futurist) Continuous quality improvement (CQI) has gained acceptance within all sectors of health care and across geographic and economic boundaries. It has evolved as a global strategy for improving health care in a variety of settings, spanning a broad number of issues and improving services to a variety of customers ranging from individual patients to communities. The range of applications covers not only direct patient care in primary care or hospital settings, but also disease prevention and population initiatives—such as HIV, childhood obesity, and influenza vaccination programs—under the domain of public health agencies at the local, national, and international levels. These applications are characterized by continuous, ongoing learning and sharing among disciplines about ways to use CQI philosophies, processes, and tools in a variety of settings. New applications continue to emerge, but at the same time, there are new challenges to the broad application of CQI. In this chapter, we examine the factors and processes that facilitate or impede the implementation of CQI as a dynamic programmatic innovation within a health care setting. While many of the barriers to more rapid adoption of CQI in health care were reduced during the first decade of the 21st century, we continued to face many challenges to the widespread adoption of CQI. Some of these challenges were due to the scientific method— for example, the definition of evidence-based practice and how it varied across different areas of health care, with medicine perhaps being the most rigid due to an over- emphasis on randomized, controlled trials. Satterfield et al. (2009) reviewed this issue, noting that the interdisciplinary nature of health care research requires a new broader definition of evidence-based practice. This broader model represents a transformation in thinking that might increase the flexibility and the range of methodologies that are used to make scientific 32 decisions, for example through the greater use of quasi-experimentation, and one effect of this model’s adoption might be an increase in CQI initiatives. Other transformations that have occurred include the greater emphasis on translational research and the introduction of implementation research (see Chapter 3).

Since 2010, progress in CQI has been made at the system level in the United States, as a direct consequence of national initiatives including, but not limited to, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes incentives that could serve as a catalyst for innovation such as those directed at lowering hospital acquired infections; and the implementation of new care models such as “primary medical care homes” (Somander, 2015). Also since 2011, the National Quality Strategy has been in place in the United States; this initiative, led by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is a transdisciplinary strategy to improve quality of care (AHRQ, 2017). Another major factor influencing system-wide CQI implementation, especially in public health, has been accreditation initiatives (see Chapters 11 and 12). Also noteworthy on a global scale has been progress made to expand CQI at a greater pace in resource-poor countries (see Chapter 13). While progress has been made in understanding and implementing CQI, new challenges have arisen, and old challenges persist. For example, despite incentives for prevention, significant challenges remain in reducing medical errors; these are addressed further in Chapters 9 and 10. And some of the advances in technology, which are intended, at least in part, to facilitate greater adoption of CQI at the system level, have had a negative effect on individual health care providers’ motivation to implement CQI. These include the more widespread use of electronic health records and electronic patient satisfaction surveys; these are discussed further later in this chapter as well as in Chapter 4. As a result, some important questions remain about the adaptation and diffusion of quality improvement methods, especially in regard to the central role of individual health care providers. These include questions such as: ■ Why aren’t more health care providers using CQI tools and processes? ■ Why is the gap between knowledge and practice so large? ■ Why don’t clinical systems incorporate the findings of clinical science or copy the “best known” practices reliably, quickly, and even gratefully into their daily work simply as a matter of course? The answers to these questions, which have been raised by CQI leaders such as Dr. Brent James (Leonhardt, 2009) and Dr. Donald Berwick (2003), are multifaceted.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_1"}}],["576",{"pageContent":"as a matter of course? The answers to these questions, which have been raised by CQI leaders such as Dr. Brent James (Leonhardt, 2009) and Dr. Donald Berwick (2003), are multifaceted. Central to this issue is the question of how to influence practitioners to adopt new ideas and the broader topic of diffusion of innovation in health care. The remainder of this chapter will address several questions: ■ What is the current state of quality in health care, and what are the problems regarding implementation of CQI in health care? ■ Given the widespread application of CQI in recent years, what are the factors that contribute to the implementation of CQI across industries and settings? ■ Specifically for our application in health care, what are the factors that have influenced the rate of diffusion and spread of CQI in health care? ■ What steps are needed to develop a culture in health care where CQI is the norm? ▸ The Current State of CQI in Health Care There has been progress in improving quality and safety of patient care since the publication of the Institute of Medicine’s landmark reports The Current State of CQI in Health Care 33 To Err Is Human (IOM, 2000) and Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001). Although there is evidence that there are global trends leading to ongoing improvements in health care, an earlier assessment of the state of health in the United States (Swensen et al., 2010, p. e12[1]) still persists today: U.S. health care is broken. Although other industries have transformed themselves using tools such as standardization of value-generating processes, performance measurement, and transparent reporting of quality, the application of these tools to health care is controversial, evoking fears of “cookbook medicine,” loss of professional autonomy, a misinformed focus on the wrong care, or a loss of individual attention and the personal touch in care delivery. … Our current health care system is essentially a cottage industry of nonintegrated, dedicated artisans who eschew standardization. … Growing evidence highlights the dangers of continuing to operate in a cottageindustry mode.

These statements were made at a time when the United States was launching the most major health reform in its history, the ACA, amid great opposition—opposition that still continues today. The challenge of the coming years continues to be how to build on the gains that we have made in the past and how to fix what many still consider a broken system. Rather than assume that we have any easy answers—which we do not—some time will be devoted in this chapter to examples of successes, with a particular focus on CQI philosophies and processes, as models of how to generalize these successes more widely. Hopefully this will give us some direction toward a set of ideas to expand the implementation of CQI across a broader range of providers. Dr. Brent James, former Executive Director of the Institute for Health Care Delivery Research and Vice President of Medical Research and Continuing Medical Education at Intermountain Health Care, in an interview with the New York Times, gave several examples of how Intermountain Health Care led the way to value-based care through the use of CQI processes. He identified the lack of widespread change as being directly related to the complexity of the health care system; a clear symptom of the depth of problems that persist is that the American health care system is vastly more expensive, but not vastly better, than the health systems of other countries (Leonhardt, 2009). Intermountain Health Care has also led the way to the future by implementing innovations that are rooted in past philosophies and processes of CQI, most notably Deming’s process management theories. In a 2011 report, they demonstrated the basic CQI principle that the most effective way to reduce health care costs is to increase quality, using methodologies that are sustainable and generalizable to the entire nation, and which could facilitate the greater and more effective implementation of the ACA (James & Savitz, 2011). (Further details and ideas for academic discussion of the process for achieving success at Intermountain Health Care can be found in a case study describing the “Intermountain Way to Positively Impact Costs and Quality” [Savitz, 2012].)

In 2003, he noted “Americans spend almost 40% more per capita for health care than any other country, yet rank 27th in infant mortality, 27th in life expectancy, and are less satisfied with their care than the English, Canadians, or Germans” (Berwick 2003, p. 69). Two of the important issues at the heart of this problem, complexity and cost, were also key factors in the debate about health reform in the United States in 2009; they are also contributors to the explanation of why CQI has not been 34 Chapter 2 Factors Infl uencing the Application and Diff usion of CQI in Health Care more widely adopted. He also addressed the issues of complexity and cost is his introduction of the Triple Aim of health care, to be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008). The complexity of the health care system is both a challenge and a source of ideas for how to make improvements (Plsek & Greenhalgh, 2001). Health care can be described as a complex adaptive system, a concept that has implications for how to improve the system. For example, the importance of leadership is critical, as are incentives for improvement. As a complex adaptive system, health care can only be designed to a certain extent and cannot be designed around minimizing costs; rather, the focus must be on maximizing value (Rouse, 2008; Spath & Kelly, 2017). ▸ CQI and the Science of Innovation While health care is unique in many ways, one commonality that it has with other complex endeavors is the difficulty surrounding diffusion of innovation, starting with simple resistance to change but including many other complex factors. Understanding these issues helps to provide pathways toward greater diffusion of CQI in health care. The research and principles that are specific to diffusion of innovation of health services are summarized in a systematic review of the literature presented by Greenhalgh et al. (2005). From this review, it is noted that there is a wide range of literature using a variety of concepts and approaches that describe how to move along the spectrum from the initiation of a concept for change to the spread, diffusion, and institutionalization of innovation.

Diffusion theory is useful in understanding the factors that thwart or support the adoption of CQI in health care. Because of the complexity of health care and the added complexity of CQI, as alluded to earlier in this chapter, there are no simple answers about how to move CQI innovations into the mainstream of health care more quickly and efficiently. Complexity must be considered in understanding innovation. Although there are competing theories about how and why, innovation clearly does happen in “complex zones.” There is some evidence that while innovation may not be susceptible to being managed, it is possible to design and control organizational conditions that “enhance the possibility of innovation occurring and spreading” (Greenhalgh, Robert, Bate, Macfarlane, & Kyriakidou, 2005, p. 80). Addressing this complexity requires, first and foremost, leadership, but also the creation of a receptive and even enthusiastic culture; one excellent example of how this has been accomplished in CQI in health care is the formation of quality improvement collaboratives, such as the SURPASS collaborative group, which among many accomplishments includes the successful application of surgical checklists to improve patient safety (de Vries et al., 2010). The speed and overall adoption of any change, including CQI, can be influenced by the characteristics of the change and how it is perceived by those responsible for implementation. These characteristics include relative advantage, compatibility, simplicity, trialability, and observability (Rogers, 1995). All of these characteristics relate to changes and improvements in health care, and two are particularly relevant to health care: compatibility, which relates to how closely the change ideas align with the existing culture and environment, and trialability, which addresses how the changes can be adapted and tested in the new environments in which they are being spread. A further extension of these change concepts yields the following seven rules for dissemination of innovation in health care (Berwick, 2003): 1. Find sound innovations. 2. Find and support innovators. 3. Invest in early adopters. CQI and the Science of Innovation 35 4. Make early-adopter activity observable. 5.

Find and support innovators. 3. Invest in early adopters. CQI and the Science of Innovation 35 4. Make early-adopter activity observable. 5. Trust and enable reinvention. 6. Create slack for change. 7. Lead by example. All of these rules are applicable to innovations around CQI; leadership, trust, and reinvention are fundamental. Reinvention has to do with the cross-disciplinary learning concept that has permeated CQI and is responsible for its evolution across industries and across the globe. CQI cannot be a top-down mandate. It must be part of the vision of an organization and accepted by all who must implement CQI, thus requiring trust at all levels, which comes from leadership, teamwork, and Deming’s concept of “constancy of purpose.” Top leadership must be involved, supporting and communicating the vision for innovation and change; however, participation, buy-in, and support from opinion leaders at all levels within an organization are critical for successful implementation and the process of reinvention. One size will not fit all. As described by Berwick, “To work, changes must be not only adopted locally, but also locally adapted” (2003, p. 1974). Berwick asserts that for this to happen, there must be reinvention. In his words, “Reinvention is a form of learning, and, in its own way, it is an act of both creativity and courage. Leaders who want to foster innovation … should showcase and celebrate individuals who take ideas from elsewhere and adapt them to make them their own” ( Berwick, 2003, p. 1974). The checklist tool cited in Chapters 1 and 8 of this book is a clear illustration of this process of reinvention and leadership. It was adapted from the airline and other industries, first to intensive care and later to surgery, with trusted leaders in their fields and disseminating their ideas and successes via scientific venues. The fact that these evidence-based tools are not fully accepted and used returns us to the point that health care is complex and requires diligence to spread the improvement process. The systematic review of diffusion of innovation in health services identifies complexity as one of the key elements that is inversely associated with successful diffusion.

Quite often, due to the complex nature of health care systems, equally complex quality improvement strategies are required, thus lessening their quick and easy adoption. This helps to explain why simpler quality improvement processes, such as the use of PDSA cycles, have enjoyed broad success. But other factors may need to be considered to overcome resistance to changes in health care procedures and understand how these changes truly lead to improvements (Langley et al., 2009). For example, a prospective study of the attributes of 42 clinical practice recommendations in gynecology (Foy et al., 2002) helps to explain what these factors may be. After review of almost 5,000 patient records, findings indicate two relevant outcomes that explain why there may be unexpected resistance to change. First, recommendations that were compatible with clinician values and did not require changes to fixed routines were associated with greater compliance. Second, initial noncompliance could be reversed after audit and feedback stages were carried out, indicating that perhaps more time will yield greater compliance. This is especially to be considered when evaluating improvements in outcomes (vs. processes), which may require more time and repeated cycles of process changes to take hold and be sustained. The techniques and philosophies described throughout this book provide some other examples of progress that has been made in specific segments of health care and also describe models that can be considered to increase diffusion of CQI ideas. For example, social marketing has been documented as being an effective tool for understanding ways to improve the impact of innovations in health care in general (Greenhalgh et al., 2005). In Chapter 8 of this text and in an illustrative case study ( Breland, 2012), a novel social marketing approach is 36 Chapter 2 Factors Infl uencing the Application and Diff usion of CQI in Health Care proposed as a technique for increasing compliance with use of surgical checklists and other CQI innovations. ▸ The Business Case for CQI Health care delivery systems are large, decentralized, and complex, yet at their core they involve a fundamental personal relationship between providers and patients.

Although evidence has been accumulated from both controlled trials (Goldberg, Wagner, & Finh, 1998; Mehta et al., 2000; Solberg, 1993) and survey data (Shortell, Bennett, & Byck, 1998) on the implementation process and perceived impact, much of the evidence remains anecdotal (Arndt & Bigelow, 1995; Bigelow & Arndt, 1995). Leatherman et al. (2003), for example, argue that the “business case” for quality improvement is yet to be proven, even while evidence mounts for the overall societal and economic benefits: A business case for a health care improvement intervention exists if the entity that invests in the intervention realizes a financial return on its investment in a reasonable time frame, using a reasonable rate of discounting. This may be realized as “bankable dollars” (profit), a reduction in losses for a given program or population, or avoided costs. In addition, a business case may exist if the investing entity believes that a positive indirect impact on organization function and sustainability will accrue within a reasonable time frame. (p. 18) These arguments continue; the economic case includes the returns to all the actors, not just the individual investing business unit. The social case, as they define it, is one of measuring benefits, but not requiring positive returns on the investment. That has been overriding the consideration in the battle to control medical variation and medical errors (McGlynn, Asch, & Adams, 2003). The business case for quality improvement suffers from the same negative factors as the business case for other preventive health care measures—namely, all or part of the benefits accruing to other business units or patients, and delayed impacts that get discounted heavily in the reckoning ( Leatherman et al., 2003).

These authors also present a whole array of public policy measures that would overcome the barriers to a positive business case and encourage wider and more assertive implementation of quality improvement methods. Clearly, economics alone does not provide an argument strongly for or against the use of CQI, but it does add to the complexity that pervades the wider and more rapid implementation of CQI in health care. In summary, this brief overview indicates that a strong business case for CQI in health care cannot be made. Looking back over the past 40 years, Robert Brook, UCLA Professor of Medicine and Health Services and Distinguished Chair in Health Care Services for the RAND Corporation, observes, “Although there are some examples in the literature to support the concept that better quality of care is less expensive, few studies have produced information that could be generalized across time and institutional settings” (Brook, 2010, p. 1831). Building on the traditional business concepts that have been discussed and in consideration of the limited evidence to support the business case for CQI, a transformation that may The Business Case for CQI 37 support greater diffusion of CQI and the continuing need to bridge the quality chasm is to consider a more value-based approach to CQI in health care. This approach argues for simultaneous goals of higher quality and lower cost, which will only be achieved when there is a reorientation among CQI proponents that includes a thorough understanding of how to achieve a positive return on investment (Brook, 2010). This view is consistent with the Triple Aim of Health Care described by Berwick, Nolan, and Whittington (2008) and its most recent recommended enhancement, the Quadruple Aim (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014); it will be discussed in greater detail in the final chapter of this text (Chapter 14), which will address future quality trends in health care. ▸ Factors Associated with Successful CQI Applications Despite the need for greater diffusion of CQI in health care, much progress has been made, suggesting a broad array of factors that can be associated with successful CQI implementation.

This analysis starts with regulatory (e.g., accreditation) factors and organizational factors such as leadership, organizational culture, and teamwork; and finishes with individual providers’ internal/intrinsic motivation, perhaps the most important factor for adoption of innovations and CQI. Capturing the Intellectual Capital of the Workforce Industrial managers are increasingly recognizing that frontline workers know their work processes better than the management does. Therefore, management encourages workers to apply that knowledge and insight to the firm’s processes. This is especially true in health care, where the professionals employed by or practicing in the institution control the technological core of the organization. Management that does not capitalize on this available pool of professional and specialized knowledge within the organization is naive at best. Reducing Managerial Overhead Some companies have been able to remove layers of management as work groups have taken responsibility for their own processes. Health care organizations are actually already limited in the number of staff positions, mostly because the professionals, rather than the corporate staff, have clinical process knowledge. Indeed, one might view the new investments in CQI as a catching-up process for the lack of process-oriented staff that are involved in process enhancement in most other industries. This is but another example of how the incentives in health care are misaligned. Since physicians are not employees in most community hospitals, they are not at risk when processes are suboptimal, unless the situation is so bad that it prompts a lawsuit. Lateral Linkages Health care organizations are characterized by their many medical specialties, each organized into its own professional fiefdom. Specialization is just one response to an information overload in the organization (Galbraith, 1973). By specializing, each unit tends to learn more and more about less and less. One way to offset the effects of this specialization is to provide lateral linkages—coordinators, integrating mechanisms—to get the information moving across the organization as well as up and down the chain of command (Galbraith, 1973; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). So far, that has proved very difficult in health care institutions.

The technology of CQI focuses as much on coordination of the change process as on its motivation. In modern medicine, as practiced in the 21st century, this coordination and motivation of CQI is bolstered by the need for greater coordination in medical care in general and is therefore quite natural. There is a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary care, which leads to fostering interdependence and, in turn, better teamwork, including greater employee engagement and improvements in the patient experience and the financial performance of practices (Swensen et al., 2010). Regulatory Agencies and Accreditation Regulatory mechanisms such as accreditation are key factors that have led to greater diffusion of CQI and will continue to do so in the future as a direct result of mandated measurement and improvement of the quality of care. Chapter 12 will provide a broad overview of accreditation and its impact across the globe, but for the purposes of this discussion, a focus on the United States is illustrative. In the United States, the efforts of The Joint Commission (TJC) and CMS have led to the implementation of a series of initiatives that require hospitals to report on quality measures; after a period of strong resistance, routine reporting of key metrics is now commonplace and required for accreditation by TJC; and has been reinforced by provisions in the ACA (Somander, 2015). Also, as described in Chapters 11 and 12 of this text, accreditation initiatives at the national and state levels have served as an impetus for CQI in public health agencies in the United States. The local health department accreditation system in North Carolina also serves as an example of CQI innovation at a state-wide level, as it was one of the first states to implement mandatory public health accreditation, which has led to sustainable CQI efforts (Stone & Davis, 2012). Likewise, CMS generates extensive CQI activities and associated reporting of findings via the efforts of Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs). QIOs represent a clear example of diffusion of CQI in health care and continue to play an important role in ensuring the highest quality of care to the millions of beneficiaries covered by Medicare in the United States.

QIOs are a clear example of diffusion, as they grew from what they were in 1972 when they were termed Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSROs) (Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013). (For an in-depth discussion and to provide a series of academic questions to be considered for understanding how QIOs work, readers are referred to an illustrative case study provided by Rokoske, McCardle, and Schenck, 2012.) The processes for each of these regulatory mechanisms provide evidence for factors to be considered, as well as lessons learned, in regard to further diffusion of CQI in health care. For example, the impact of the measurement requirements has been notable. In a review published by members of TJC, this impact was described as being due to the use of robust, evidence-based measures, which link process performance and patient outcomes ( Chassin, Loeb, Schmaltz, & Wachter, 2010). Despite extensive documentation of successes in the article, these authors also note the need and define a direction for further improvement, centered on process measurement. They point out that the focus of this measurement process is entirely on hospital care, leaving much to be done in regard to ambulatory care. They also note that the measures in place are process measures, not outcome measures. In the spirit of continuous improvement, they offer guidance in improving the measures that are currently in place. Once again, this program, while not without problems, is a good model for further diffusion of CQI; early resistance to measurement no longer exists, and now the issue is more Factors Associated with Successful CQI Applications 39 about finding the most effective measures, with little resistance expected from hospitals and physicians. In the language of diffusion of innovation, TJC has passed the early adoption stage and is now well into the institutionalization stage, at least in the hospital sector, and relative to a subset of process measures.

So a partial answer to our question of how to “fix the broken system” is provided by accreditation, and much has been accomplished, with some guidance from TJC on what to do next. However, these comments are specific to measurement of processes in hospitals, and a more general answer is still needed to truly address the broader health care system and its subcomponents. Motivational Factors A number of motivational factors contribute to the sustained interest and enthusiasm for health care improvement. These factors have an impact on the motivation of the management of the organization and its employees. The first argument for CQI is its direct impact on quality, usually a net gain to the customer/ patient and to the employees of the organization, the external and internal customers. The second argument relates to the set of benefits associated with a plan that empowers employees in health care through participation in decision making. These factors represent benefits for employees and management that can be classified as follows. Internal/Intrinsic Motivation With the proper internal or intrinsic motivation, the vast majority of health care workers support the concept of quality care and would like to see improvements and participate in a meaningful quality improvement process. Allowing personnel to work on their own processes, permitting them to “do the right thing,” and then rewarding them for that behavior is almost sure to increase intrinsic motivation in employees, if done properly. It is a classic case of empowerment and job enrichment for health care workers and follows the principle clearly delineated by Deming about the important role of internal (vs. external) motivation and employee engagement in CQI efforts. It should be noted that internal and intrinsic motivation will be used interchangeably throughout this text, representating the form of motivation that Deming describes as being linked to self-esteem and dignity (1993). System of Profound Knowledge It is well known that the system of profound knowledge and the original 14 points of Deming (see Chapter 1) emphasize high levels of trust, empowerment, and especially internal motivation and engagement as important factors associated with implementation of CQI initiatives (Deming, 1986,; 1993). This is clearly and succinctly emphasized in Deming’s point number 12: “","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_13"}}],["588",{"pageContent":", empowerment, and especially internal motivation and engagement as important factors associated with implementation of CQI initiatives (Deming, 1986,; 1993). This is clearly and succinctly emphasized in Deming’s point number 12: “remove barriers that rob people of pride of workmanship” (Deming, 1986, p. 77). In health care, and especially in nursing and medicine, one indication of demotivation and lack of engagement is the increasing rate of burnout and work dissatisfaction in recent years (Shanafelt et al., 2015). A systematic review and meta-analysis reported in The Lancet in 2016 described physician burnout as reaching epidemic proportions (West, Dyrbye, Erwin, and Shanafelt, 2016). Burnout, which can be defined as the opposite of engagement, is indicated by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and perceived lack of personal accomplishment; and in health care, burnout is manifested by diminished personal well-being and longevity and leads to decreased quality of patient care 40 Chapter 2 Factors Infl uencing the Application and Diff usion of CQI in Health Care (Chew et al., 2017). Provider burnout has also been linked to greater patient dissatisfaction and higher costs. Examples that have been cited of lower quality/safety of care resulting from burnout include prescribing inappropriate medications (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014). Reports of physician burnout have been persistent during the second decade of the 21st century, as indicated by findings from two large studies, which reported prevalence of at least one symptom of burnout as high as 54.4% in 2014 (Shanafelt et al., 2015) compared to 45.5% in 2011 (Shanafelt et al., 2012). In both studies, the sample sizes consisted of over 3,000 responding physicians; although response rates were in the 20% range, which may compromise the ability these data have to serve as predictors of population parameters, the consistency and large sample size that these findings are based on are indicative of a longterm trend that burnout is consistent and may be worsening over the time period between these two studies. Other studies in the United States and Europe of a range of types of health care providers, including nurses and staff as well as physicians, yield similar findings. For example, one provider survey","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_14"}}],["589",{"pageContent":"and may be worsening over the time period between these two studies. Other studies in the United States and Europe of a range of types of health care providers, including nurses and staff as well as physicians, yield similar findings. For example, one provider survey, in 2013, in the United States found that 60% of respondents reported burnout and 34% indicated that they planned to look for another job (Bodenheimer & Sinsky 2014). A 2015 survey of British physicians reported that 44% of respondents reported very low or low morale, with similar findings for nurses and health care staff (Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015). Among the various factors that thwart innovation and CQI implementation, burnout and low morale are often mentioned not only for the sake of encouraging innovation, but more importantly, to improve the health and well-being of health care providers. A key question for all in health care and specifically to address the topic of this chapter is how to reverse these trends; how to eliminate factors that may be causally related to burnout and how to identify factors that will increase the rate of innovation and CQI implementation. From Triple Aim to Quadruple Aim An important innovative concept that was first introduced in 2008 is the Triple Aim of Health Care (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008). This innovation broadens the goals and definition of quality health care through the simultaneous pursuit of three aims: “improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita costs of health care” (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008, p. 759). Since its introduction, the adoption of the Triple Aim has become a goal of many health care providers both nationally and globally and can be viewed as a new stage in the ongoing evolution of CQI in health care; it has done so by using a systems optimization perspective and has taken advantage of associated innovations that have facilitated the implementation of systems to pursue the Triple Aim. For example, adoption of the Triple Aim has benefited from improvements in technology, such as the broader overall use and the institutionalization, at least in large hospital systems, of electronic health records. It has also benefited from CQI tools and techniques that have become more widely adopted in recent years such as elimination of waste in health care processes via LEAN/Six Sigma, described in Chapter 5","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_15"}}],["590",{"pageContent":"large hospital systems, of electronic health records. It has also benefited from CQI tools and techniques that have become more widely adopted in recent years such as elimination of waste in health care processes via LEAN/Six Sigma, described in Chapter 5. The introduction of the Triple Aim is an example of innovation in health care systems, and the application of a systems approach utilizing synergy derived from the interdependence of the three aims. However, this interdependence requires careful attention to system optimization since changing any one has a direct impact on the other two aims. This important characteristic has direct implications on the further adoption of CQI in health care, which requires that intrinsic motivation for change and improvement is maintained by providers. For example, if cost reductions lead to overburdening busy providers with lower leverage tasks, then they may not be motivated to identify Factors Associated with Successful CQI Applications 41 and implement new CQI ideas. The costreduction mentality that is described in some business models as “doing more with less” can also lead, in health care, to poorer quality and lower patient satisfaction if tradeoffs are not carefully understood and managed. Quadruple Aim Although many health care providers have adopted the Triple Aim, others have not been able to do so successfully. One explanation for less than full implementation may be that “practices working toward the Triple Aim may increase physician burnout and thereby reduce their chances of success” (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014, p. 575). A partial explanation for this trend is that some of the very same factors that lead to successful adoption of the Triple Aim may have inadvertently led to burnout and demotivation among some health care providers. For example, the widespread increase in utilization of electronic health records, a plus factor for implementing the Triple Aim, has been shown to lead to increases in burnout (Babbott et al., 2014). Provider burnout and dissatisfaction, the opposite of internal motivation and engagement, may also lead to a reluctance to adopt or lead the development of innovations/CQI initiatives. Because of its possible causative links to burnout, the Triple Aim, while by definition designed to lead to greater CQI implementation and innovation in health care, may inadvertently have the opposite effect, at least in some cases.

To address this conflict in positive and negative effects of pursuing the Triple Aim, one solution that has been proposed is to expand the Triple Aim by adding a fourth aim— improving the work life of clinicians and health care staff and increasing the experience of joy and meaning in health care work ( Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014; Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015). The key question is, how? As with many CQI initiatives the solution of expanding from a Triple Aim to a Quadruple Aim must start with a system-level focus. For example, one form of system optimization that is proposed to implement the Quadruple Aim for primary care is to shift relevant responsibilities from physicians to practice staff but at the same time ensuring that “staff who assume new responsibilities are well trained and understand that they are contributing to the health of their patients and that unnecessary work is reengineered out of the practice” (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014, p. 575). This approach represents just one of many possible system changes that can be included under the umbrella of empowerment, a well-established, cost-effective approach to improve internal motivation and engagement (Daft, 2015). It also requires attention to the concept of task-relevant maturity for ensuring that those who are empowered are prepared to accept greater responsibility, including receiving adequate training (Grove, 1995). The successful application of these concepts may require an initial investment in dollars and time that will offer a future return on investment. And most important, it requires a culture that is open to transformational leadership concepts (Daft, 2015) such as empowerment and a vision that embraces innovation and improvement; such a culture is described in the next section of this chapter. In summary, the concept and effectiveness of the Triple Aim will be further improved by the addition of a fourth aim that focuses on the welfare of providers because “maintaining a balance between workforce satisfaction and patient satisfaction will be critical in achieving the fourth aim. Reductions in physician and staff burnout will support the primary goal of the Triple Aim, improving population health” (AHRQ, 2015). Stated more succinctly, “health care is a relationship between those who provide care and those who seek care, a relationship that can only thrive if it is symbiotic” (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_17"}}],["592",{"pageContent":"2015). Stated more succinctly, “health care is a relationship between those who provide care and those who seek care, a relationship that can only thrive if it is symbiotic” (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014, p. 575). And this symbiotic relationship is at the core of successful CQI implementation. 42 Chapter 2 Factors Infl uencing the Application and Diff usion of CQI in Health Care ▸ Culture of Excellence Throughout the history of the application of CQI, one of the most important factors associated with successful applications of CQI has been the interaction of leadership, organizational culture, teamwork and internal motivation. Transformational leadership, distinguished by its emphasis on vision, is a starting point and a consistent force in motivating change and improvement. “Transformational leadership is characterized by the ability to bring about significant change in both followers and the organization. Transformational leaders have the ability to lead changes in the organization’s vison, strategy and culture as well as promote innovation in products and technologies” (Daft, 2015, p. 360). To ensure CQI, the most important role of a leader is transformation (Deming, 1993), which starts with a motivating vision that must be developed, communicated, and embraced by all in the organization, and which in turn leads to high levels of commitment to the vision of change and improvement (Melum & Sinioris, 1993; Tichy & Devanna, 1986). Leaders ensure commitment to the vision by shaping a culture that not only accepts but embraces change (Balestracci, 2009; Schein, 1991).

Also similar is a clearly defined, shared vision that translates into detailed procedures, decision-making processes based on teamwork, and strategic actions that lead to achievement of the vision of quality and safety. A culture of excellence is one that ensures high quality at every customer interface and in which a commitment to the highest quality—and CQI, in particular—is shared by all in the organization. Underlying the creation of a culture of excellence is a need for a systems view. A systems view of health care emphasizes the importance of adding value and the importance of leadership rather than management, influence rather than power, and the alignment of incentives focused on quality rather than quantity of services (Rouse, 2008).

It exemplifies the following elements outlined in Figure 2.1: ■ Customer focus: Emphasizing the importance of both internal and external customers (see Chapter 1). It should be noted here that in defining the population who will ultimately benefit from health care innovations and CQI (i.e., the external customer), there may be some discomfort with the generic term “customer,” especially among physicians and nurses (Houpt, Gilkey, & Ehringhaus, 2015). There should be awareness of this issue, especially when developing a culture to embrace the ideas presented here, but for simplicity and consistency with terminology presented here and in the CQI literature in general, the term customer will continue to be used—as a term that denotes the highest respect for the patients, their families and communities served in health care. ■ Systems thinking: Maintaining a goal of optimizing the system as a whole and thereby creating synergy (Deming, 1986; Spath & Kelly, 2017). ■ Statistical thinking: Understanding causes of variation and the importance of learning from","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_19"}}],["594",{"pageContent":"■ Systems thinking: Maintaining a goal of optimizing the system as a whole and thereby creating synergy (Deming, 1986; Spath & Kelly, 2017). ■ Statistical thinking: Understanding causes of variation and the importance of learning from measurement; having the ability to use data to make decisions (see Chapter 4 and Balestracci, 2009). ■ Teamwork: Teams of peers working together to ensure empowerment, thereby creating the highest levels of motivation to ensure alignment of the organization, the team, and the individual around the CQI vision (see Chapter 6 and Grove, 1995). ■ Motivation and empowerment: A key component of the culture of excellence is its ability to increase empowerment and internal motivation necessary for any successful CQI initiative (Deming, 1986, 1993). Ultimately, this will lead to higher levels of engagement. “The most recent thinking about motivation considers what factors contribute to people’s willingness to be fully engaged at work and “go the extra mile” to contribute their creativity, energy and passion on the job. One approach is to foster an organizational environment that helps people find true value and meaning in their work. One path to meaning is through employee engagement” (Daft, 2015, pp. 245–246). A culture of excellence creates an environment where empowerment, motivation and engagement are the norm. It should ultimately address the need for “joy in work” by providing a platform for the Quadruple Aim to be achieved; and in a cyclical manner this will in turn further increase the motivation of health care providers to be innovative and embrace CQI initiatives. ■ Communication and feedback: Maintaining open channels of communication and feedback to make adjustments as needed, including modifying the vision to achieve higher levels of quality in a manner consistent with a learning organization (Senge, 1990), including feedback that is fact-based and given with true concern for individuals’ organizational success (Balestracci, 2009). Open communication and feedback are key characteristics of the team approach necessary to achieve the goals of CQI (see Chapter 6). Leadership and Diffusion In discussing factors that support the implementation of CQI, the theory of diffusion of innovation clearly supports the important role of leadership in CQI.

Furthermore, organizational leadership is critical to the development of a culture that fosters innovation (Greenhalgh et al., 2005 ). CQI is a form of change and innovation that also requires cultural change driven by leadership. As Greenhalgh et al. explain, “Leaders within organizations are critical firstly in creating a cultural context that fosters innovation and secondly, establishing organizational strategy, structure, and systems that facilitate innovation” (2005, p. 69). This perspective ties directly back to Deming’s point about leadership: leaders must know and understand the processes they are responsible for and lead by example, acting as part of the improvement effort and on the “corrections” required (Deming, 1986). This point was emphasized by Gawande (2009, p. 146) in describing how the initial adoption of surgical checklists was accomplished: Using the checklist involved a major cultural change, as well—a shift in authority, responsibility, and expectations about care—and the hospitals needed to recognize that. We gambled that their staff would be far more likely to adopt the checklist if they saw their leadership accepting it from the outset. Leaders at All Levels Various types of leaders can contribute to (or detract from) the innovation process. Traditional organizational and team leaders are most often associated with CQI initiatives; however, in regard to innovations, the terminology of “leader” can be expanded to include opinion leaders, champions, and boundary spanners. Opinion leaders represent a broad range of leaders “within the ranks” as well as those at the top level. In clinical settings, opinion leaders have influence on the beliefs and actions of their colleagues, either positive or negative in regard to embracing innovation. Opinion leaders may be experts who are respected for their formal academic authority in regard to a particular innovation; their support represents a form of evidence-based knowledge. Opinion leaders may also be peers who are respected for their know-how and understanding of the realities of clinical practice (Greenhalgh et al., 2005).

Opinion leaders may also be peers who are respected for their know-how and understanding of the realities of clinical practice (Greenhalgh et al., 2005). Unlike opinion leaders, who may support or oppose an innovation, champions persistently support new ideas. They may come from the top management of an organization, including technical or business experts. Champions include team and project leaders and others who have perseverance to fight both resistance and/or indifference to promote the acceptance of a new idea or to achieve project goals (Greenhalgh et al., 2005). Boundary spanners represent a combination of these various types of leaders and are distinguished by the fact that they have influence across organizational and other boundaries (Greenhalgh et al., 2005; Kaluzny, Veney, & Gentry, 1974). Boundary spanners play an important role in multi-organizational innovations and quality improvement initiatives, such as quality improvement collaboratives. Each of these types of leaders is found in the adoption of quality improvement initiatives in health care, and often these various types of leaders are found in combination. Teamwork CQI in health care is a team game. These teams are composed of peers who are highly trained technical experts supporting each other and empowered to take a leadership role as required to meet the needs of customers. Teamwork is one of the most important components of all successful CQI initiatives; team building centers on the ability to create teams of empowered and motivated people who are leaders themselves and who will take the lead as needed to foster change, innovation, and Culture of Excellence 45 improvement (Byham & Cox, 1998; Grove 1995; Kotter, 1996). The glue that holds a culture of excellence together and that ensures there will be quality at every interface is the link between leadership and teamwork—with leadership exhibited as called for at all levels within a team. As Deming states, “There is no substitute for teamwork and good leaders of teams to bring consistency of effort along with knowledge” (1986, p. 19). Motivation and Empowerment Inherent in teamwork is a high level of empowerment of team members, which in turn leads to high levels of motivation. Empowerment implies that levels of authority match levels of responsibility and training. For example, suggestions and interventions can be made to allow improvements and prevent problems or errors.

Empowerment implies that levels of authority match levels of responsibility and training. For example, suggestions and interventions can be made to allow improvements and prevent problems or errors. This initiative goes beyond simply allowing team members to speak up; it means ensuring they are comfortable speaking up when something seems wrong (Byham & Cox, 1998; Deming, 1986; Grove, 1995). Improved motivation is the direct result of transformational leadership and especially its emphasis on empowerment. Motivation and empowerment both will interact to lead to higher quality; but to work, these elements require another aspect of cultural change and associated leadership responsibility—building a culture of trust. This is emphasized in Deming’s 14 points, namely point number 8: Drive out fear. Create trust. Create a climate for innovation (see Chapter 1). Deming explains, “No one can put in his best performance unless he feels secure. … Secure means without fear, not afraid to express ideas, not afraid to ask questions” (1986, p. 59). This ties directly back to the surgical checklist example as well as the airline safety tradition, where use of a checklist implies responsibility to communicate and question each other as part of the checklist process, regardless of the team member’s rank. A leader’s goal must be to create a culture where people are empowered to do their jobs to the best of their abilities, with trust and a clear understanding of the vision that creates the constancy of purpose needed to achieve the highest quality. Training is critical to the success of leaders and the ability to achieve constancy of purpose, not only training of employees in the skills required to do their jobs, which removes barriers to motivation, but also training the future leaders of the organization, which creates further motivation. Training of future leaders is one of the most important responsibilities of a leader (Tichy, 1997). And it is a key characteristic of transformational leadership; “transformational leadership inspires followers … motivates people to do more than originally expected … develops followers into leaders” (Daft, 2015, p. 361). Gawande (2009) addresses this issue in describing the process for testing and implementing the surgical safety checklist.

Despite the obvious key role of the surgeon, it was decided that the “circulating nurse” on the surgery team would be the one to start the checklist process at the beginning of a surgery. This was done for several reasons, but one of the most important was “to spread responsibility and the power to question” (p. 137). Examples of Leadership and Teamwork in CQI The linkage between leadership and teamwork to ensure success in quality improvement in health care has been demonstrated in many instances, including the very successful implementation of quality improvement collaboratives (QICs). QICs represent a form of virtual organizations (Byrne, 1993) the effectiveness of which have been demonstrated in industry for many years. Part of the success of QICs can be tied to this effective team structure. For example, in describing the successful application of a QIC using the IHI Breakthrough series (Kilo, 1998) in 40 U.S. hospitals to reduce adverse drug events, Leape et al. (2000) identify strong leadership and teamwork among their most important success factors: “Success 46 Chapter 2 Factors Infl uencing the Application and Diff usion of CQI in Health Care in making significant changes was associated with strong leadership, effective processes, and appropriate choice of intervention. Successful teams were able to define, clearly state, and relentlessly pursue their aims, and then chose practical interventions and moved early into changing a process” (Greenhalgh et al., 2005, p. 165). Further examples of QICs and their importanace in the future of CQI in health care are presented in Chapter 14. In summary, leadership, effective teamwork, and the empowerment of teams, which lead to higher levels of internal motivation, have been critical factors in the evolution of CQI in health care and are directly related to the pace and broad adoption of CQI in health care in recent years. Chapter 6 provides a detailed description of how to build teams and ensure that they operate most effectively to improve quality in health care. Grove (1995) provides examples of how to create an organizational structure that supports multiple teams working in parallel and how to ensure efficiency in doing so. ▸ Kotter’s Change Model A traditional model that is used to define a culture of change and in particular the role of vision and leadership is the eight-stage","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 2 - Factors Influencing the Application and Diffusion of CQI in Health Care_24"}}],["599",{"pageContent":"organizational structure that supports multiple teams working in parallel and how to ensure efficiency in doing so. ▸ Kotter’s Change Model A traditional model that is used to define a culture of change and in particular the role of vision and leadership is the eight-stage change model developed by John Kotter (1996), which is outlined in BOX 2.1. The discussion of leadership, organizational culture, and teamwork presented previously described “what is” the type of culture that is needed to implement successful CQI initiatives; Kotter’s model describes “how to” implement major change and also provides guidance on traditional errors to avoid. These two approaches are closely related. There is clear overlap between Kotter’s model and the factors defined in Figure 2.1, which describe the culture of excellence. These common elements include empowerment, communication, feedback loops to produce more change, and, most important, the central role of vision and anchoring change in the culture. The presentation of Kotter’s model, which is well known with widespread application beyond health care, also serves as validation for the basic concepts of the Culture of Excellence Model. One key point of Kotter’s model that is worthy of a bit more discussion here is his first point: “Establishing a sense of urgency.” This point relates to an earlier discussion about how long it takes, or should take, to implement CQI concepts. The emphasis is not that decisions should be rushed, but that complacency is to be avoided. Complacency may be due to many reasons that can be associated with the need for CQI in health care. These include, according to Kotter, “too much past success, lack of visible crises, low performance standards, [and] insufficient feedback from external constituencies. … Without a sense of urgency, people won’t give that extra effort that is essential. They won’t make needed sacrifices. Instead they cling to the status quo and resist initiatives from above” (1996, p. 5). This point directly relates to CQI in health care; the importance of ensuring safety and quality in health care requires a sense of urgency.

The literature on diffusion of innovation suggests some guidelines to understand factors that influence the adoption of CQI. Understanding the factors that enable or influence adoption of CQI, as well as the factors that present barriers, is particularly important as more countries around the world are utilizing CQI to solve health challenges, including resourcepoor countries and as national health initiatives are being modified or introduced around the world, including in the United States. Among the factors that are gaining greater attention is the emphasis on cost, efficiency and value. The emphasis on value is directly correlated with concerns about the costs of quality health care and has led to novel concepts such as the Triple Aim of health care— simultaneously focusing on care, health, and cost.

This consideration has been driven in part by demotivation resulting from increasing rates of burnout that have been reported among health care providers. Central to promoting the diffusion of innovation, and in particular CQI, is leadership, vision, and teamwork, resulting in empowerment and motivation of the health care workforce.

Hirschhorn It is often difficult, and indeed not always helpful, to separate intervention from context to the extent that transplanting a programme in its entirety from one setting to another is rarely straightforward. — Mary Dixon-Woods he most consistent challenges to continuous quality improvement (CQI) throughout its evolution in health care have been ensuring the broadest adoption of evidence-based improvements in practice and motivating research into further improvements of processes and outcomes.The challenge of how to maximize adoption of CQI-proven practices is addressed in this chapter through an introduction to implementation science as a methodology to increase the adoption and implementation of innovations and improvements in health care-practice settings. Drawing on its multidisciplinary roots and applications, implementation science represents a next step in the evolution of CQI in health care. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Implementation Science Defined Implementation is “a specified set of activities designed to put into practice, an activity, or program” (NIRN, 2018). Even if we know the interventions needed to implement or improve a program, we still need a scientific approach to make sure that these activities are executed in a way that results in their effective use. We also need to learn from this experience to accelerate change more broadly.

The emerging field of implementation science involves the systematic study of how to improve the quality of implementation of interventions and programs that are known to work, typically in health care, public health, behavioral health, education, and other settings where sustainable solutions at scale are difficult to achieve. Implementation science has a number of definitions, but it can be understood as the “scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidencebased practices into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and care … (this) field includes the study of influences on health care professional and organizational behavior.” Recognizing the importance of how and where these interventions are implemented, the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) also defines the field as “the study of factors that influence the full and effective use of innovations in practice” (NIRN, 2018). In this chapter, we describe the key principles of implementation science and how integrating these principles into improvement strategies can be a valuable step to helping quality improvement (QI) programs achieve their desired results. While the use of QI methods such as Lean, Six Sigma (see Chapter 5), or the Model for Improvement (introduced in Chapter Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

For example, a recent systematic review of Lean methods concluded that there is little evidence to support the claim that Lean leads to improved health care (Moraros, Lemstra, & Nwankwo, 2016). The lack of a systematic approach to implementation is one reason for this conclusion. The most common QI methodologies do not incorporate a systematic approach to the implementation of the improvement solution—a failing that can lead to an incorrect conclusion that the solution isn’t effective. For example, Six Sigma’s Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) process (FIGURE 3.1) moves directly from the Improve step (where improvement","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 3 - Integrating Implementation Science Approaches into Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 3 - Integrating Implementation Science Approaches into Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 3 - Integrating Implementation Science Approaches into Continuous Quality Improvement_1"}}],["610",{"pageContent":"lead to an incorrect conclusion that the solution isn’t effective. For example, Six Sigma’s Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) process (FIGURE 3.1) moves directly from the Improve step (where improvement solutions are generated and prioritized) to the Control step (where the postimprovement process is monitored for stability) without any mention of the context-specific details needed to guide the implementation of the selected solutions. The Wall Street Journal reports that 60% of Six Sigma projects fail to achieve the desired results, because “in the middle stage of an improvement project—when the Six Sigma expert moves on to another project and top management turns it focus to another group of workers—implementation starts to wobble, and teams may find themselves struggling to maintain the gains they achieved early on” (Chakravorty, 2010). The three questions framing the Model for Improvement (FIGURE 3.2) are structured to help teams develop improvement solutions but do not address their implementation and often neglect the broader organizational changes needed for immediate success as well as sustainability of change.

In other words, it is not enough to use QI methods rigorously to come up with a solution that works. It is equally important to be rigorous about applying the approaches and tools from implementation science to put these solutions into effective practice and sustain the changes. The key ingredients needed for interventions to achieve successful outcomes are summarized in FIGURE 3.3 (Bertram, Blase, & Fixsen, 2015). Positive outcomes require an intervention that is appropriate to the context, which QI methods can help to develop. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. But the intervention is just one ingredient. An implementation approach appropriate to the setting and resources and a supportive organizational, policy, or funding environment are needed as well. The multiplicative nature of these “ingredients” means that failure in any of these steps will decrease the chance that desired outcomes are achieved. FIGURE 3.3 Key Ingredients for Achieving Outcomes Modified from National Implementation Research Network FIGURE 3.4 shows how quality improvement methods and implementation science approaches can work together to achieve effective outcomes in health care and in public health. Systematic improvement methods help to create effective interventions (sometimes referred to as change packages) that fit the local context. Implementation science methods can be used to identify appropriate implementation strategies to ensure effective implementation of the change package. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Integrating Implementation into QI: The Model for Improvement and Implementation Incorporating the tools and methods of implementation science in a systematic way requires enhancing the Model for Improvement with implementation steps. We refer to this model, shown in FIGURE 3.5, as the Model for Improvement and Implementation (MFII). This model incorporates three implementation questions into the traditional model for improvement.

Analogous to improvement aims, these outcomes specify the implementation aims to ensure quality implementation in a particular setting or context, such as feasibility, fidelity, acceptability, or cost. The second question addresses implementation determinants, or factors that may affect the implementation outcomes in that context.

As a result of this testing, it may become apparent that the change package is inappropriate for the context and may need to be modified or adapted. This will initiate the redesign of the change package and the creation of a new improvement solution. Improvement and implementation are thus intrinsically connected in the joint model. Implementation Outcomes The first implementation question of the MFII is intimately connected to the first improvement question, What are we trying to accomplish?, because we cannot achieve health improvement goals if improvement interventions are not implemented well. Implementation outcomes are defined as “the effects of deliberate and purposive actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services” (Proctor et al., 2011). In other words, implementation outcomes measure how well the implementation process worked, since the quality of the implementation process affects how well the QI intervention achieves the desired health outcomes. There are more than 500 studies offering evidence that the quality of implementation affects health outcomes (Durlak & DuPre, 2008). Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

TABLE 3.1 Implementation Outcomes and Definitions Implementation Outcome Definition Acceptability Perception that an intervention is agreeable or satisfactory. Adoption Uptake of an intervention by practitioners or providers. Appropriateness Fit of an intervention to a particular context or setting. Cost Money, resources, time, or effort needed to implement an intervention. Feasibility The extent to which organizational resources, motivation, and capabilities can support the implementation of an intervention. Fidelity The match between how an intervention is intended to be delivered and how it is actually delivered. Penetration The extent to which an intervention reaches the population for whom it is intended. Sustainability The extent to which an intervention becomes part of an organization’s everyday practice. Quality improvement project teams can use Figure 3.6 to select the implementation outcomes most likely to affect the achievement of their improvement aims. For example, an improvement intervention that relies on fast ambulance services to improve referral processes affecting the timeliness of care may not be feasible or may be too expensive in low-resource settings where ambulance services are not easily available. In this context, feasibility and cost may be the most important implementation outcomes that affect the ability to improve timeliness of care. In the case of an intervention focusing on improving patient satisfaction by enhanced provider/patient communication, acceptability of new communication protocols by providers may be the primary implementation outcome of interest. For a hand-hygiene intervention, adoption by clinicians may affect the reduction in health care-associated infection (HCAI) prevalence. In this case, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

How should these implementation outcomes be integrated into the work of QI teams? After teams have defined the change package to be implemented as part of the QI initiative, they will consider the implementation questions in MFII and determine the implementation outcomes that are most relevant to the successful implementation of their change package. They will collect baseline measures for their selected outcomes and set targets for the implementation outcomes that will result in sustained achievement of the improvement outcome. Implementation outcomes can be measured in a variety of ways. Perceptual measures such as feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, or adoption can be measured through surveys or through semi-structured interviews or routine measurement depending on the indicators chosen. Some of these measures may be integrated into the data collection plan of the QI project without the need for additional work. For most QI projects, a simple survey with a few questions might suffice. But if more rigor is needed, validated survey instruments exist for these outcomes (Weiner et al., 2017; Roberts, Becker, & Seay, 1997). Fidelity can be measured through observations of adherence (Carroll et al., 2007) to a practice or protocol using checklists (Breitenstein et al., 2010). Cost and reach can be measured through reviews of operational documents (e.g., admissions registers or accounting records). Lewis and colleagues (Lewis et al., 2015) identified 104 instruments for measuring one or more implementation outcomes. BOX 3.1 illustrates the use of implementation outcomes in improvement work at a hypothetical hospital. “Mercy Hospital” is a tertiary hospital with a mature QI program.

Guided by implementation scientists, Mercy Hospital QI teams are beginning to use the MFII to improve their quality of implementation. The evidence-based communication protocol is their first project to use the enhanced model. BOX 3.1 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 1 The QI team at Mercy Hospital seeks to increase average patient satisfaction by 25% through an improvement change package involving an evidence-based provider/patient communication protocol that has been shown to work in controlled experiments. To ensure that they can successfully implement the change package at Mercy, they talk to key stakeholders (leadership, physicians, nurses) in the facility to determine the barriers to implementation. Based on these conversations, the team determines that the greatest barrier to implementation of this protocol is provider acceptability and selects acceptability as the implementation outcome of interest. An acceptability survey administered to providers indicates that currently, only 25% of the providers consider the protocol “highly acceptable.” The team determines that at least 75% of the providers will need to find the protocol acceptable to ensure successful implementation. This is a necessary precursor to realizing the desired patient outcomes—in this case, patient satisfaction. Implementation Determinants The second implementation question in the MFII asks, What are the factors that facilitate and impede the achievement of the implementation aim? These are referred to as implementation determinants in the implementation science literature. In a Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Nilsen (2015) identified 13 “determinant” frameworks in which the “aim is to understand and/or explain influences on implementation outcomes, e.g., predicting outcomes or interpreting outcomes retrospectively.” One of the most widely accepted of these is the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al., 2009), commonly referred to as CFIR. The framework has been tested widely in many different contexts. A systematic review identified 26 studies that have used the framework (Kirk et al., 2016). FIGURE 3.7 shows the graphic of the framework, which consists of 39 factors affecting implementation organized by five domains that are similar to those described in Table 3.2. Definitions of each of the factors are provided in APPENDIX 3.1. Extensive documentation to support the use of the framework by practitioners and researchers is available at the CFIR website. To explore how CFIR can be used to identify factors that affect implementation outcomes, BOX 3.2 returns to the hypothetical example of implementing provider/patient communication protocols described earlier.

BOX 3.2 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 2 Recall that the implementation outcome of interest at Mercy Hospital was the acceptability of the communication protocol to providers. The CFIR domains provide a systematic way of identifying the most important barriers to acceptability. Reviewing the results from the staff survey, the team determines that the individuals involved and the inner setting (i.e., organizational characteristics) are the most important determinants affecting the acceptability of the protocol. These include service provider knowledge regarding the communication protocol, their beliefs about their ability to implement it, and organizational attitudes towards change. To get a deeper understanding or these determinants, the team may conduct additional interviews with the staff and leadership of the facilities or use questionnaires to measure organizational readiness for change. Simple, locally developed questionnaires might suffice, but for those requiring rigor, several validated instruments such as the Acceptance of Change Scale (ACS) to measure individual attitudes (Di Fabio & Gori, 2016), or the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change (ORIC) instrument (Shea, Jacobs, Esserman, Bruce, & Weiner, 2014) to assess organizational motivation and capacity for implementation are available in the literature.

The drivers are shown in FIGURE 3.9 and are categorized into competencies (hiring, training, and support needed to ensure that staff are well equipped to implement), leadership (ensuring that leaders have both the management skills and the ability to adapt to changing implementation environments) and organization (use of data to drive decisions, organizational support for change, and integration of the implementation with other external policy and resource priorities).

BOX 3.3 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 3 Recall that the most relevant implementation outcome was acceptability of the protocol and that surveys and interviews conducted by the QI team identified the individuals involved and the inner settings as the CFIR domains of interest. Based on Table 3.4 and 3.5, the QI team may select developing stakeholder interrelationships, training and educating stakeholders, and some financial incentives or disincentives as categories from which to create a collection of implementation strategies. From Appendix 3.3, the team may select applicable detailed strategies. TABLE 3.6 shows the strategy categories and the detailed strategies that may be used as defined in Powell (2015). As shown in Figure 3.4, the selected implementation strategies are tested, refined, and tailored for to the implementation context using PDSA cycles. The third column of Table 3.6 describes how this leads to particular adaptation of the strategy to implement the communication protocol in the context of Mercy Hospital. Johnson, J.

Implementing Well: Using Frameworks for Implementation Even the best implementation strategies will not be of use unless they are implemented well. Several frameworks for guiding the implementation process exist in the implementation science literature. We will describe two that are useful to practitioners: Stages of Implementation, which is one of the AIFs described earlier, and the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation. The NIRN stages of implementation framework describes four stages through which the implementation of an intervention takes place (Bertram et al., 2015). The stages are shown in FIGURE 3.10. The Exploration Stage overlaps with some of the planning activities mentioned previously to assess organizational readiness for implementation, identify key factors affecting implementation, and develop implementation strategies. During the Installation Stage, resources for carrying out the implementation strategies are acquired, both for the actual implementation itself and for any technical support that may be required. Training of staff may also take place at this stage. The Initial Implementation is where the intervention is implemented for the first time, using the implementation strategies. The strategies themselves may be tested and adapted during this stage, and any changes to the intervention may be considered. During Full Implementation, ongoing testing and refinement may take place, but the intervention begins to get embedded in the organization and becomes part of everyday work. Johnson, J.

The stages overlap with each other, and there may be situations where there may be the need to cycle back to earlier stages based on the results of tests of strategies (e.g., if it is apparent during initial implementation that staff have not been trained adequately or are not motivated, it may be necessary to go back to some of the installation and exploration activities of staff preparation and readiness building). The Interactive Systems Framework (Wandersman et al., 2008; Scaccia et al., 2015) shown in FIGURE 3.11 conceptualizes implementation occurring through interactions between three systems: the synthesis and translation system, the support system, and the delivery system.

The support system provides training, coaching, tools, and technical assistance needed for implementation. The delivery system is where the work gets done. According to the framework, successful implementation requires an appropriate implementation strategy, and motivation and capacities to both support the implementation and to deliver it in practice. The framework distinguishes between general capacities and innovation-specific capacities. The former relate to overall organizational capabilities and include factors such as leadership, adequate resources, organizational readiness to change and innovate, and effective processes for support and delivery that are needed for the successful implementation of any intervention. The latter refer to knowledge, skills and abilities and organizational support that are unique to the intervention itself.

As described by Leeman et al. (2017), a collection of selected implementation strategies such as the one shown in Table 3.6 is nothing more than a list until the strategies can be embedded in the implementation process. For implementation to be successful, different strategies need to be used at different implementation stages and in different systems, and the frameworks provide guidance on how to do this.

TABLE 3.8 shows how the Interactive Systems Framework (ISF) may be used for implementation planning. BOX 3.4 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 4 Using the Stages of Implementation Framework (Table 3.7): In the exploration stage, the QI team continues to identify factors that might affect the quality of implementation and develops a package of strategies. In the installation stage, the team may begin conversations with early adopters who might serve as champions, and test and refine the messages that these champions should disseminate to other service providers. Once the messages have been finalized, the team may test the different methods for dissemination (e.g., face-to-face presentations at staff meetings, informational flyers, video presentations, and so forth). As more departments begin to use the protocol, the champions and other staff members involved in the implementation may organize local seminars and workshops where staff can share their experiences about the implementation process. Over time, as the protocol becomes part of everyday use, staff leaders in various departments may monitor its use and continue to provide support for implementation as required and training as new providers enter the system. Using the Interactive Systems Framework: We can also use the Interactive Systems Framework to develop an implementation plan for the strategies in Table 3.6. The ISF helps to ensure that all aspects of the implementation are considered in a systematic way. As shown in Table 3.8, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Conclusions The purpose of this chapter is to introduce quality improvement practitioners to some of the key principles, concepts, and tools of implementation science. Over the years, the fields of quality improvement and implementation science have progressed side by side. QI methods have focused on the development of change packages and interventions with the assumption that someone else will take care of implementation or that implementation is the easy part if the intervention is sound.

Implementation science has been concerned with the adaptation and implementation of evidencebased interventions, often without a real understanding of what the intervention is and how it has been developed. As a result, improvement interventions are often poorly implemented, and implementation science has failed to benefit from the wealth of practical knowledge about theories of systems, processes, and variation that are cornerstones of good QI practice. The intent of this chapter is to bridge this gap. QI practitioners, armed with implementation science tools will be well equipped to realize the old adage: “What is worth doing is worth doing well.” Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Sollecito and David Hardison Information is random and miscellaneous, but knowledge is orderly and cumulative. —Daniel Boorstin Continuous quality improvement (CQI) requires knowledge about the behavior of systems and processes, which is most often obtained from data and other sources of information collected for that specific purpose and through the application of tools and techniques that have proven to be effective throughout the evolution of CQI as described earlier in this text. The use of data and tools is part of the concept of statistical thinking, which is a key component of both the philosophy and processes of CQI. Central to decisions about innovations and especially CQI in health care is the need to improve our knowledge about health care process performance through an understanding of the context in which processes behave, asking the right questions, and then the collecting and analyzing appropriate data. The goal is not simply to analyze data, but to gain knowledge by utilizing data to understand processes, sources of variation, and the impact of improvements. Most important in CQI applications is the requirement to understand variability and the predictability of health care processes. As described in Chapters 1 and 2, CQI requires a systems approach that analyzes assumptions and focuses on customers/ patients, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

All rights reserved. processes, and interdependencies based on knowledge. This approach is most efficiently accomplished using stepwise, yet cyclical, procedures that span planning, implementation, and an assessment of the impact of the decisions made in identifying and applying changes—including how to determine when a change is needed and whether it leads to an improvement (Langley et al., 2009). Although many different methods can be applied to carry out these steps, CQI efforts in the past have spawned methods that have proven to be robust and efficient when focused on listening to the “voice of the process” underpinned with an understanding of variation (Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). These methods include a continuous assessment of process performance, including an understanding of sources of variation, followed by decision making based on the application of knowledge about systems and measurements. Over the years, a set of tools have been developed to carry out these steps in the most efficient manner; as with CQI itself, these tools have undergone a continuous improvement process that enhances our learning about how to apply them, and when to introduce new tools. Especially in health care, which itself has undergone an evolutionary process rooted in new knowledge and the greater use of technology, new tools and data sources have been developed to ensure that the “Quadruple Aim” of health care—improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita costs of health care while improving the work life of clinicians and health care staff (discussed in Chapter 2)—has been met (Bodenheimer & Sinsky, 2014; Sikka, Morath, & Leape, 2015). At the heart of these procedures is the use of evidence-based approaches that rely on health information technology that provides high-quality data to ensure that correct decisions are made in the efficient application of the “data-to-decision cycle” (McLaughlin & Kibbe, 2013). The greater use of technology to collect and analyze health care data presents greater opportunities for both converting Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Many valuable texts are available that explain the mechanics of CQI analysis methods and tools (e.g., Balestracci, 2009; Bialek, Duffy, & Moran, 2009; Carey & Lloyd, 2001; Langley et al., 2009; Lighter & Fair, 2004; Lloyd, 2019; Streibel, Sholtes, & Joiner, 2003). This chapter will not duplicate the information provided in those texts. Rather, the purpose of this chapter is to assist in understanding the role of variation in quality improvement, why measurement and statistical thinking are vital to quality improvement efforts, and to illustrate a few fundamental CQI tools that are particularly useful in health care to enhance our learning about process changes and facilitate improvement in health care processes. A minimum, but sufficient amount of detail, with relevant examples, will be provided to enhance understanding and enable the reader to develop and apply these tools. Finally, the chapter presents a brief overview of the strengths and weaknesses of various forms of health information data sources that are currently being used to carry out CQI initiatives.

Health Care Systems and Processes The early work of Donabedian is foundational in understanding health care systems and processes (Donabedian, 1980). He described the process of care as a system involving three components: structure, process and outcomes that comprise a set of activities requiring interaction between patients and providers. More recently, there has been greater attention paid to patient centered care and the Donabedian model has been expanded to include greater emphasis on the patient experience (Spath & Kelly, 201","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_2"}}],["654",{"pageContent":"comprise a set of activities requiring interaction between patients and providers.

Process Capability To understand the expected output of a process relative to a particular outcome or quality characteristic, or process capability, the process must be stable, and, hence, predictable within limits. Benefits of a stable process (Deming, 1986) include: ■ The process has an identity (capability); it is predictable. Therefore, there is a rational basis for planning. ■ Costs and quality are predictable. ■ Productivity is at a maximum and costs at a minimum under the present system. ■ The effect of changes in the process can be assessed with greater speed and reliability. In an unstable process, it is difficult to separate changes to the process from special causes of variation. Therefore, it is more difficult to know when a change results in improvement. Interpreting Process Requirements and Performance Variation exists in every process and always will. It is the manager’s job to understand variation and continuously improve the processes so that they manage to meet the needs of the customers who depend upon their processes. The customer of each process has requirements which specify the level of performance that is needed. A provider working in the emergency department (ED) would require more rapid turnaround time (TAT) of laboratory results than a provider working in a primary care office. A 30-minute TAT in the ED may be unacceptable, whereas a 24-hour TAT may be acceptable for a primary care office.

Process requirements may be thought of as the criteria from which the effectiveness of a process may be evaluated from the process customer’s perspective. They function as both inputs to designing a process and outputs from executing a process. It is essential to first identify the customers of a process. Chapter 7 provides an indepth discussion of customers of health care organizations (i.e., the role of patients in CQI). Brief definitions, using a systems perspective, are provided here. A customer is defined as anyone who has expectations regarding a process operation or outputs. In health care delivery organizations, the primary customer is the patient, while the community may be the primary customer for a public health agency. Internal customers are those within the organizations and are sometimes thought of as those departments or coworkers “downstream” from the process. In other words, who the customers of a process are depends on the outputs of a process. For example, the recovery room or postanesthesia care unit may be thought of as the customer of the operating room. Patient care units may be thought of as customers of diagnostic departments (e.g., laboratory, radiology). Payers may be considered as external customers—those outside the provider organization. A stakeholder is anyone with an interest in or affected by the work you do.

Regulatory bodies such as The Joint Commission (TJC), formerly known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or the National Commission on Quality Assurance (NCQA) would be considered stakeholders for hospitals and health insurance companies, respectively. Professional societies that define practice standards may also be thought of as stakeholders. The market refers to the environment in which you operate and do business and may include socioeconomic, demographic, geographic, and competitive considerations. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A.

Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. Once customers, stakeholders, and markets have been identified, it is essential to identify and understand what they require of your services. For example, patients may require access and competent, courteous providers; payers may require a certain level of clinical results delivered in a cost-effective manner; regulatory bodies require compliance; and markets may require a culturally diverse approach to delivering services. These requirements are vital to determining what services are needed and how the processes comprising the services are designed and improved. These requirements also provide the basis for selecting variables or attributes that will measure the process performance from the perspective of the customer.

The third column lists the attributes or variables that the organization measures to understand the degree to which its processes are meeting stakeholder requirements. It is management’s job to ensure that the process requirements (also referred to as the Voice of the Customer) and the process performance (also referred to as the Voice of the Process) are aligned (Carey & Lloyd, 2001; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). If the two are not in alignment, then the process must be improved. The analysis of process performance must be based upon knowledge of the sources of variation in the process (i.e., common and special causes). This process analysis which will be described in detail later in this chapter, is accomplished by collecting data on process outcomes, plotting that data over time, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A.

This is essentially converting those data into information and knowledge (Ross, 2014). Other considerations, to be discussed later in this chapter, include choosing the optimal sources of data with consideration of data quality and choosing appropriate tools and techniques that are useful for carrying out these analyses. Each of these methods has a common approach to be successful in analyzing process performance; that is the need for careful measurement and an understanding of sources of variation, which will be covered in the next sections.

Gaining Knowledge Through Measurement In order to convert data into knowledge and make appropriate decisions about process improvements, critical and statistical thinking is required. This sounds very simple, but in our modern age of high-speed computing, it is all too easy to apply statistical methods and focus on results without the necessary step of thinking critically and understanding what our data tell us about the system we are trying to improve. This point was emphasized in 1996 by Dr. Donald Berwick, among others, when he noted that “measurement is only a handmaiden to improvement, but improvement cannot act without it. We speak here not of measurement for the purpose of judgment (for deciding whether or not to buy, accept, or reject or who to blame) but for the purpose of learning” (Berwick, 1996, p. 621). Not only is this view consistent with the guidelines for improvement spelled out in the earliest applications of CQI—for example, by W. Edwards Deming in his well-known 14 points (1986)—this view is also well understood and espoused in recent statistical literature (Balestracci, 2009; Langley et al., 2009). With this cautionary note in mind, we will address the important concept of understanding process variation. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

The Critical Role of Understanding Variation It has long been established that a starting point for any quality improvement effort is understanding variation (Deming, 1986, 1993; Nolan & Provost, 1990; Nolan, Perla, & Provost, 2016; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_8"}}],["660",{"pageContent":"is understanding variation (Deming, 1986, 1993; Nolan & Provost, 1990; Nolan, Perla, & Provost, 2016; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). It was Shewhart’s idea (1931) that statistically controlled variation of processes (also called statistical process control) is the foundation of all empirical CQI activities. In fact, listening to the voice of the process with knowledge of variation will lead to the appropriate actions to take for improvement and is fundamental to CQI (Deming, 1986, 1993; Nolan, Perla, & Provost, 2016; Nolan & Provost, 1990; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). One of the key elements of the system of profound knowledge proposed by Deming (1993) is knowledge about variation and how it interacts with other elements of knowledge to lead to a transformation based on CQI. As quality improvement has evolved over the years from business applications to health care, the concepts related to understanding variation have also been applied specifically to health care with many examples and how the action required for improvement is dependent on this understanding (Carey & Lloyd, 2001; McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006; Nelson, Splaine, Batalden, & Plume, 1998). This section introduces the general concept of variation, discusses variation in relation to processes, and begins to describe why measurement and appropriate analysis are vital to guiding actions for improvement. Its emphasis is on health care applications, with numerous examples presented. Variation: What Is It and Why Study It?

Common causes of variation are the causes and conditions inherently present that impact every outcome of a process. Special causes of variation are not a part of the process all of the time and do not affect every outcome but arise because of specific circumstances (Deming, 1986). For the sake of completeness and clarity, it should also be noted that some authors refer to these two causes in process analysis as noise and signals, respectively (Wheeler, 2000). The appropriate action for improvement depends upon the correct interpretation of patterns in the variation observed. Is the variation random and attributable to the materials, methods, environment, people, etc. that are common to every outcome, or was there a signal of a trend or another discernable pattern in the data indicating that a special cause is present in the process? As will be described shortly in our discussion of process behavior charts, variation in a process over time can be measured, analyzed, and displayed in a manner that helps to distinguish its source (i.e., special vs. common cause). The importance of understanding this classification of causes directly relates to predictability of the outcomes of a process, and where special causes of variation are detected, outcomes are not predictable with any reasonable degree of belief (Deming, 1986; Langley et al., 2009; Shewhart, 1931; Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler & Chambers, 2010). This is of critical importance in health care. Berwick (1991) describes the role of variation and predictability in processes carried out daily in health care organizations: Johnson, J.

Each makes plans in accordance with those predictions, and each bases those predictions on prior experience, which is judged to be informative. Sudden, unpredicted variation is experienced as trouble. (p. 1217) From the national, organizational, or individual perspective, one cannot escape the role and influence of variation on health care quality (Gold, 2004). Understanding causes of variation and using that knowledge to determine when and how to make process improvements involves the use of tools and procedures designed for these purposes. A key point to remember is that these tools can be used together in a complementary cyclical manner to identify the need for process improvement, decide on what improvements are needed, measure the impact of those changes and assess what further improvements are needed. For example, the use of process behavior charts may lead to the identification of special causes of variation, which will require process improvement; the determination of specific steps needed to make improvements can be accomplished through involvement of team members in a brainstorming exercise or other analyses to identify process changes, and implementation and measurement of the impact of changes will require methods such as the PDSA cycle described throughout this text; then followed by use of process Johnson, J.

A process is said to be stable and “in statistical control” if only common causes are affecting the outcomes over time. This does not mean that the outcomes are good or bad or that there is no variation. It means that the outcomes are predictable within statistically determined limits. Similarly, an unstable process is a process in which outcomes are affected by both common and special causes, and the outcomes are unpredictable. The appropriate actions for improvement of a process depend upon whether the process is stable or unstable. If the process is unstable, then variation is produced by both common and special causes so the appropriate action for improvement is to investigate and prevent the special causes from happening again. Once the process is stable, then the appropriate action for improvement is to make a change which reduces or removes some of the common causes. Luckily, Shewhart (1931) provided a method to operationally define a stable process using a control chart. Control Charts/Process Behavior Charts The control chart, which is often described as one of many CQI tools (Bialek, Duffy, & Moran, 2009; Langley et al., 2009) is arguably the most important since it represents a powerful methodology for explaining concepts of process variation. It was first developed by Shewhart as a methodology for analyzing and understanding process variability and predictability (Shewhart, 1931; Wheeler, 2000, Wheeler & Chambers, 2010).

A control chart is a plot of process measurements over time overlaid by three statistically computed lines: a center line, an upper control limit, and a lower control limit. The vertical axis of a control chart represents the actual value of the measure we are studying to assess process performance and variability; the horizontal axis represents the time scale over which we have collected process measures. One important goal of a control chart is to display individual process data in a time series, which is much more useful than simply analyzing measures of central tendency alone (e.g., an arithmetic average), when carrying out a process behavior analysis in CQI. In this way, a control chart illustrates and concentrates on the behavior of the underlying process. The upper and lower control limits of a process behavior chart define the Natural Process Limits (i.e., what the process will deliver as long as it continues to operate as consistently as possible), thus describing what Wheeler (2000) defines as the voice of the process. While the Run Chart, which will be described later in this chapter, is also an extremely useful CQI tool for displaying time series summaries of process measures, the control chart has one very important unique capability and purpose: it is the most powerful tool for distinguishing between common and special causes of variation and predicting future performance of a stable process within a range (Langley et al., 2009). Further increasing the usefulness of this tool, but also adding some level of confusion, especially to novices in CQI, is that there have been many types of control charts described in the CQI literature over many years.

Before describing details about how to produce control charts, it is useful to review the interpretive concepts that are common to all forms of control charts. FIGURE 4.1 shows a series of X-bar charts, including a solid center line (mean, i.e., arithmetic average) and two dashed lines, representing lower and upper control limits. These three charts illustrate the following: Segment (A) represents a situation when the data are considered to be stable; the points do not go outside of the control limits and there are no discernable patterns within the limits. This process will continue to produce predictable outcomes within these limits as long as the conditions that produced all of these results continue. The latter is a subject matter judgment, not a statistical one. Improvement will come from changing the process that impacts every output of the process (i.e., the common causes). In segment (B) there are values outside the control limits; thus, the process is unstable due to special causes of variation. The appropriate action is to investigate the special causes and determine how to remove them. Finally, segment (C) describes the situation when there is a discernable pattern within the control limits. In this case, there are too many values in a row below the center line. The exact definition of how many is too many varies by several factors, including sample size and number of time points. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

In addition to measuring process behavior to determine common vs. special causes of variation, control charts are also used to assess the impact of an improvement effort by continuing to plot the process outcomes after a change is made to the process. The change should show up as a special cause signal in the chart and should settle down to a new center line over time unless unplanned special causes impact the process. The process should continue to be monitored and the same diagnostics and actions for improvement as described previously should be employed. XmR Charts “Individual values” charts, also called XmR charts, have proven to be the very useful in health care and have the advantage of being “non-parametric,” thereby being applicable to a multiple types of measurement scales. Wheeler points out that when measurements are based on counts or percentages and data are displayed in p charts, for example, assumptions are necessary about the specific probability models (e.g., binomial or Poisson) in order to compute theoretical limits; however, XmR charts are based on empirical limits and no assumptions are needed (Wheeler, 2000, p. 140).

The center line of the X chart is typically the average (mean) of the individual X values and the Upper Control Limit or UCL is the average(of X values) +2.66 times the average of the Moving Ranges. The Lower Control Limit or LCL is the average(of X values) − 2.66 times the average of the Moving Ranges. Similarly, the center line of the mR chart is the average of the Moving Ranges and the UCL is 3.27 times the average mR. There is no LCL for the mR chart since the absolute values are used.

In these cases, it will be more appropriate to use the median of the X values and the median of the mR versus the average (mean) X and average (mean) mR, respectively. When this is done, the statistical scaling factors have to be changed. The value of 2.66 changes to 3.14, and the value of 3.27 changes to 3.87.

This is accomplished in various ways, including using other CQI tools, such as those presented later in the chapter, e.g., construct a causeand-effect diagram with a team of people who work in the process to understand the sources of common cause variation. PROCESS BEHAVIOR CASE STUDY In order to illustrate the construction and use of a process behavior chart, in particular an XmR chart, the following hypothetical case study is presented. University hospital, a large academic teaching hospital, has been undergoing expansion throughout its state. As part of its goal to increase access to quality care in rural areas it has opened a new primary care facility in a rural part of the state. This initiative included transferring well trained, experienced clinical staff as well as hiring/training local staff in administrative roles.

Some questions that needed to be answered are as follows (these are provided for readers to consider in their own health care environment): 1. What would be some examples of process measures to collect? 2. How to effectively analyze these measures to understand what the level of quality is? 3. How to decide if and when changes in processes are needed? 4. What specific changes should be made and who decides? 5. How to determine if the changes made were improvements?

We leave it up to readers of this chapter to discuss these questions and to think of others that might be appropriate—especially after completing this chapter; but to illustrate process behavior charts, we will focus on Questions 2 and 3. To answer any of these questions data collection is required. A useful methodology, especially in this setting when a new center is opening, is to collect daily measures and display them in a process behavior chart. The experienced administrator knows that long waiting times really annoy patients and are symptoms of inefficiency. She also knows that waiting times get increasingly worse throughout the day if the clinic does not get off to a good start. Therefore, she wants the staff to track a simple but important metric that she believes will play an important role in clinic quality and patient satisfaction: Amount Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W.

This metric would not only measure clinic efficiency but could also have a direct impact on several other quality measures, most notably waiting time and patient satisfaction. To answer questions 2 and 3 above the administrator first met with the staff to operationally define how they would measure clinic preparation time, including who would be responsible and when it would be measured each day. She planned to have another meeting with the clinical staff after 2 weeks of data collection and teach them how to display and interpret the data on a process behavior chart. Data were collected each day for the first 2 weeks of operation; the clinic opened on Monday, June 5, 2017, and data were collected until June 18, 2017.

It contributes to knowledge about the process because it helps us to understand the right questions to ask; to hear the “voice of the process.” 2.

It allows us to study and learn from the variation in each pair of time points and adds substantial knowledge about the process beyond just knowing the average and range of values. 4. Most important, it provides a methodology for understanding sources of variation and separating “noise vs. signals”; it prevents us from taking unnecessary actions and helps us to know when actions are needed to address special causes of variation.

Each pairwise difference, or moving range (mR), is computed and recorded; the average of the moving ranges in Table 4.3A is 2.23 minutes. As noted above, the average of the individual (X) values and the average of the moving ranges (mR) are needed to compute the upper (UCL) and lower (LCL) control limits of this process behavior chart.

The chart in Figure 4.2A is the process behavior chart for the data displayed in Table 4.3A; preparation times for the first 2 weeks of clinic operation. This chart reflects the voice of the process. The fact that all of the first 2 weeks of preparation times are within the control limits of 10.4 and 22.2 minutes indicates that the process is stable, and the variability observed is due only to common causes of variation. The process will continue to perform in this range unless a special cause occurs to disrupt the process. If there is a signal of a special cause below the lower limit, the clinic team should investigate and determine if the reason is repeatable or just a fluke. If it is repeatable and could be incorporated into the process daily, then a process change should be planned and implemented since this would represent a shortening of the daily preparation time—an improvement. If there is a special cause signal above the upper limit, the team should also investigate and seek to prevent the special cause from recurring.

The team should be alerted to investigate immediately if a point exceeds the upper control limit or if runs of data (e.g., a large sequence of times above the mean) are observed. (Please refer to the Run Chart section later in the chapter which defines other rules for detecting patterns or “runs” in the data that may be signals to be investigated further.) The chart was updated daily and continued to operate within limits until July 4, when preparation time was observed to be 24 minutes, higher than the upper control limit (see TABLE 4.3B and FIGURE 4.2B). The person taking the measurement immediately polled the team about what was different that day. Obviously, it was a holiday, though that did not explain the special cause. Further discussion with the team indicated that there had been a power outage during the night due to a thunderstorm, and one of the computers used to check in patients failed to reboot automatically. A manual restart was required, and this added to the clinic prep time. No action was taken on the clinic preparation process, and indeed the preparation time the following day fell back within the control limits and continued that way (see FIGURE 4.2C and the last Johnson, J.

XmR chart as consisting of two charts by adding a lower control chart display that presents the daily and average moving range and its upper limit. Although useful in many cases as a valuable descriptive tool, it is our experience that this lower (mR) chart is not always necessary to display, as long as the moving ranges have been computed and used to compute control limits for detecting special cause variation. However, it should be also noted that in this case analysis we did compute, but did not display, both charts. Wheeler, in a more recent journal article, presents a good summary of reasons for including the moving range chart when carrying out a process behavior analysis (Wheeler, 2010). Readers should consider these arguments and based on the specific data being analyzed make a decision as to whether both the X and mR charts are needed. For illustrative purposes both the upper chart of individual values of preparation time (X) and lower chart presenting moving ranges (mR) are presented in Figure 4.2C. The average and upper control limit presented in the lower chart are found using the formulas presented above: the average of the mR values = 2.23 and the upper control limit of the moving ranges is 7.3 (= 3.27 × 2.23).

One other important computational note regarding the XmR charts presented here is that the average of individual values (X) and moving ranges (mR) as well as the upper and lower control limits for all three charts are based only on the first 14 days of data collected. This was done for two reasons: (1) we considered the process to be stable based on the process behavior chart computed for the first 14 days (i.e., it included enough cycles of the process to reflect usual operating conditions); and (2) the first 14 days includes a sufficient amount of data (at least 10 data points). These are two general guidelines that we recommend for computing the initial averages and upper and lower control limits for generating process behavior charts, in general (i.e., Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. Created from westerngovernors-ebooks on 2023-04-25 02:03:03.

As we continue to monitor this process over a longer period of time the centerline and limits should, of course, be recalculated once it is determined that an actual shift has occurred, hopefully, due to a planned improvement. Further information on the choice of time periods to compute average and control limits in XmR charts is found in Chapter 3 of Wheeler’s text, Understanding Variation (2000), which has been cited several times in this case study and provides examples that can serve as guidance on the development and interpretation of process behavior charts, in general, and XmR charts specifically. Finally, it should be noted that the analyses and charts presented in this case study were developed using Microsoft Excel™ although other options listed below could also have been used. Although in this case study, the source of the variation was quickly identified by the team, there are often situations when more complex sources must be investigated.

With the knowledge that we have special cause variation, tools and techniques such as those described later in this chapter (e.g., cause-and-effect diagram) or methods that are described by other authors (e.g., root cause analysis; Ross, 2014) might be appropriate. When a process is stable though not performing at the level needed by the customer, strategies for improvement such as applying PDSA cycles to test whether changes that are made lead to true improvement (Langley et al., 2009) and using a team approach (see Chapter 6 for more details on the role of teams Johnson, J.

These step wise applications of improvement tools and techniques are always recommended and are especially important to follow when we are analyzing other health care processes that are more complex than the simple example presented here. For instance, please see the patient safety examples in Chapters 9 and 10. The key conclusion of this case study is that the process behavior chart is the most economic method, as originally proven by Shewhart, for gaining knowledge about a process and, more importantly, distinguishing between special and common cause variation. By understanding variation, we will know the appropriate action to take for improvements. Other Forms of Control/Process Behavior Charts As noted above there are other forms of control/process behavior charts that can also be used to assess process behavior and may be better known, such as the those that are not based on moving ranges but on means of actual values (X-bar charts) or percentages (P-charts) and are applicable when we have more than one data element per time point.

Quality Improvement Tools In Chapter 1, the Plan, Do, Study, Act cycle was introduced, with an emphasis on its broad applicability as a framework in which many other CQI processes can be applied. Many organizations, including health care organizations, have adopted the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle or a tailored version of it as their overall framework for CQI (Langley et al., 2009). Improvement begins with plotting a key quality characteristic of a process over time on a run chart or control chart. Then, depending upon the stability of the process, different tools, techniques, and methods may be used to accomplish the purpose of each phase of the PDSA cycle. (Once again, as noted in Chapter 1, readers are reminded that the PDSA cycle is sometimes described as a PDCA cycle, where “C” stands for check, as in","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_28"}}],["680",{"pageContent":"accomplish the purpose of each phase of the PDSA cycle. (Once again, as noted in Chapter 1, readers are reminded that the PDSA cycle is sometimes described as a PDCA cycle, where “C” stands for check, as in checking your results of the Plan (“P”) and Do (“D”) phases, which is equivalent to the “S” study phase of a PDSA cycle; i.e., they are two names for the same CQI process.) There is no one specified point in the CQI process where one needs to use a given method of measurement and analysis. It should be used on a continuous basis. In the context of the PDSA cycle, data and analytical tools may be used throughout the entire cycle. Different tools will be more helpful in different stages of each improvement project, from the initial analysis to monitoring changes that have already been instituted. Reemphasizing the point made earlier in this chapter about using data to learn about improvement, Berwick (1996) notes that it is critical at the studying (S) stage of a PDSA cycle to take the time to reflect and learn about the impact of improvements that have already been made. This should include evaluating whether these changes have actually been improvements and then deciding on what further improvements to make. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

This brief list of tools represents a range of types that are useful for preventing errors, describing process flow and for assessing ideas for improvement, which are suitable depending upon the type of variation present in the process. As noted above, one can visualize a life cycle of the improvement team’s efforts where these tools (and others not described here) might be applied sequentially at various project stages. Run Charts A control chart/process behavior chart has a specific purpose for distinguishing between common and special causes of variation and thereby providing valuable information about process predictability within limits. A run chart is another useful tool with broad applications in health care, to gain knowledge about process performance with minimal mathematical complexity. “Because of its utility and simplicity, the run chart has wide potential application in health care for practitioners and decision-makers. Run charts also provide the foundation for more sophisticated methods of analysis such as Shewhart (control) charts and planned experiments” (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011, p. 46).

FIGURE 4.3 Run Chart of Number of Medication Errors Once again, the most powerful tool for distinguishing between common and special causes of variation is the control chart/process behavior chart; but some important uses of the run chart (which it also shares with the control chart) are: ■ Displaying data to make process performance visible ■ Determining if changes tested result in improvement ■ Determining if we are holding the gains made by our improvement ■ Allowing for a temporal (analytic) view of data versus a static (enumerative) view (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011, p. 47) As its name implies, one very important use of a run chart analysis is to detect trends defined by runs in the data (i.e., “a consecutive sequence of data points all on the same side of the median”; Balestracci, 2009, p. 147). Balestracci (2009) provides guidance about how many values in a row constitute a run, and in particular, “the guideline” that a run of 8 or more may indicate concern","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_31"}}],["683",{"pageContent":"acci, 2009, p. 147).

All rights reserved. results in improvement, a shift in the process is expected and a new centerline (median) should be computed starting from the time that the process change was introduced; this is illustrated in the example given in Figure 4.3. Another useful characteristic of a run chart, which is easily abused if care is not taken, is the ability to identify an “astronomical data point…one that is obviously, even blatantly different from the rest of the points” (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2011, p. 48). Care should be taken when such points are observed to not assume they are due to special causes or represent signals, which can only be identified using control charts. At most, such points should be discussed by team members to understand possible causes of these values and attention should be paid to note whether they are repeated over time. A definitive determination of special or common cause can only be made by reanalyzing the process data using a control chart, to determine if the astronomical data points fall outside of control limits. Further details for how to compute and interpret run charts and, in particular their value in health care CQI, including their strengths and weaknesses are presented by Perla, Provost, & Murray (2011). Most texts on CQI methods in health care/public health describe the construction and interpretation of run charts (Balestracci, 2009; Bialek, Duffy, & Moran, 2009; Langley et al., 2009; Lloyd, 2019; Spath & Kelly, 2017).

Two tools that fall within this definition are the project checklist and process flowchart. One of the most powerful improvement tools for initiating inquiry into a process improvement project is the flowchart. Flowcharts (also called Flow Diagrams) are pictorial representations of how a process works. Simply put, they trace the steps that the input of a process goes through from start to finish. The input may be a specimen in laboratory tests, a piece of paper in medical records, or a patient in a specialty clinic. Flowcharts are used to describe the sequence of actions that must be carried out in order to complete a particular task or set of tasks. In systems thinking terminology the actions performed on inputs are sometimes described as throughput and the entire process that we are studying/improving can be thought of as a system that can be modeled using three major components: input, throughput, and output (Grove, 1995). Donabedian (1980) first introduced similar systems thinking concepts that were specific to health care when he defined a model of quality of care based on the interrelationship of structure, process, and outcome. A flowchart is a first step in describing the details (who, what, when) of each of the components in these system models. To develop a flowchart, one may proceed as follows: 1. Define the basic stages of a process. 2. Further define the process, breaking down each","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_33"}}],["685",{"pageContent":"who, what, when) of each of the components in these system models.

As the steps of a process are described, they may be documented with simple rectangles or, in some cases greater complexity can be Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

For example, an activity or action step is represented by a rectangle, a decision step by a diamond, a wait or inventory by a triangle, a document by a symbol that looks like a rectangle with a curve at the bottom, a file by a large circle, and the continuation of the flowchart to another sheet of paper by a small circle. It is very important to note that flowcharts may be as simple or as complex as you wish. It is important to agree on what level of detail is suitable for the purpose. For example, very detailed flowcharts may be used in standard operating procedures (SOPs) for highly technical procedures. A high-level flowchart may be used to describe a general overview of how the process is carried out. FIGURE 4.4 shows a high-level (simple) flowchart of the medication administration process for the inpatient setting; note that this figure also illustrates different shapes that can be used for different activities.

The development of flowcharts, with input from all team members, allows the team to achieve a common understanding of their work processes and the important customer and supplier relationships internal to the processes. These interdependencies are often the key to sustainable process improvement. With an accurate, shared representation of how the process works, the team is then better able to consider how to improve it. Once agreement is reached on the representation of the current process, the team may begin to ask questions about that process using the flow chart and guided by a control chart of measurements of process outputs, including: 1. How effective is the process in meeting customer requirements? 2. Are there performance gaps or perceived opportunities for improvement? 3. Have the relevant stages of the process been represented? Are “owners” of each stage represented on the team? If not, what needs to be done to gather their feedback and ideas? 4. What are the inputs required for the process, and where do they come from? Are the inputs constraining the process or not? Which ones? 5. Are there equipment or regulatory constraints forcing this approach? Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Staff come to know the process much better. A clear understanding of internal customers and suppliers can be gleaned from the overall process flow. The results can be used as a training aid, especially as new staff join the CQI team. People begin to take ownership of the process by participating in this activity, and most importantly, the possibilities and points in the process for improvement become clear almost immediately. And, in the language of project management, the work breakdown structure, timeline, and budget for an improvement initiative can begin to take shape through careful flow chart development (Project Management Institute, 2017).

Checklists Although it is neither a statistical tool nor a completely new tool in quality improvement, one that is very basic to both CQI and project management is the checklist. CQI in health care includes as one of its primary goals the prevention of errors (Crosby, 1979), which is an important part of the overall goal of ensuring patient safety, defined as “freedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care” (AHRQ, 2016). This includes prevention of medical errors, and adverse events (outcomes of medical care); these issues are described in Chapters 8, 9, and 10.

Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. A checklist can take many forms, but in its simplest form it is a list of process activities, usually in a time ordered sequence, that must be carried out by various members of a project or CQI team. As each task is completed, a check mark is made next to the item that was completed; in some cases, greater precision is obtained by indicating the date/time that the task was completed or, if multiple team members are involved in the process, the initials of the team member who completed the task may be entered as a way of ensuring accountability. Checklists should be derived from a process flowchart and apply to performing tasks in a stable process. Checklists have been used for many years in other industries, such as the airline industry, and they have long been an important component of the project manager’s tool kit in many different industrial and health care settings.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_37"}}],["689",{"pageContent":"to performing tasks in a stable process.

Their role in improving airline safety is well documented and is an important reason that they have now seen an accelerated evolution into medical care, which has had a greater focus on safety issues in the early part of the 21st century (Haynes et al., 2009; Gawande, 2009; Pronovost et al., 2006; Pronovost et al., 2009). Although not without controversy regarding their effectiveness (Bosk et al., 2009), their adoption as part of the medical safety process, to be used in conjunction with other well- established evidence-based practices, continues as we have entered the second decade of this century. Chapter 14 includes a critical review of some of the issues surrounding checklists and other commonly used CQI tools and techniques with a warning that before we assume that a “magic bullet” exists which can be widely applied to guarantee quality we should take time to carefully understand the context in which a CQI tool or procedure has been developed and understand the limits of its generalizability to other settings (Dixon-Woods & Martin, 2016).

A discussion of how to understand the specific issues surrounding practitioner adoption of checklists through the use of a social marketing approach is presented by Breland (2012) in the form of a case study. Cause-and-Effect Diagram Cause-and-effect diagrams, also called Ishikawa or fishbone diagrams, are one of the most widely used tools of CQI. This tool was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa (University of Tokyo) for use at Kawasaki Steel Works in 1943 to sort and interrelate the common causes of process variation (Ishikawa, 1987). Cause-and-effect diagrams are most useful to begin to identify common causes of variation once the process has been determined to be stable and documented using a process flowchart. However, they are also very useful when special causes have been identified, perhaps via a process behavior chart analysis and the next step is decide what actions need to be taken to prevent the special cause from recurring. Cause-and-effect diagrams are a schematic means of relating causes of variation to the process output and predictability. It is important to note that not all errors are special causes. Errors can be produced by a process with only common causes of variation present. Therefore, it is critical to determine the type of variation that is present before constructing the cause-and-effect diagram, since the strategy for improvement is different. In either case, the first pass at a cause-and-effect diagram may not be enough to understand the cause-and-effect relationships. Therefore, it may be necessary to stratify cause-and-effect diagrams further to achieve finer gradations of error causes. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

The length (height) of the bar against the vertical (y) axis shows the number of observations falling on that interval or event classification. The frequency chart displays the nature of the underlying statistical distribution; however, it does not provide any information about process stability and should only be used with a control chart indicating that the process is only producing statistically controlled variation.

The diagram is named after the 17th-century Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto. When he studied the distribution of wealth, he observed that the majority of the wealth had been distributed among a small proportion of the population (Pareto’s law). Juran (1988) applied this concept to quality causes, observing that the “vital few” causes account for most of the defects, while others, the “useful many,” account for a much smaller proportion of the defects. He noted that these vital few causes are likely to constitute the areas of highest payback to management. Concentrating on the high-volume causes may have the largest potential for reducing process variation once special causes have been eliminated. On the same Pareto diagram, one also develops a cumulative probability distribution incorporating all the proportions of the observations to the left of and including the bar. It is common to display the frequency scale on the left-hand side of the vertical (y) axis and the cumulative percentage scale on the right-hand edge. Segregating the causes that have large frequencies can help identify potential improvements. However, just because a cause is identified as having the greatest frequency does not necessarily mean it should be worked on first. It must also be tractable and not cost more to change than it is worth. It is likely, however, that the first cause to be studied in detail will be among the left-most group. It is important to remember that even though a cause may not be among the most frequent, if it has a devastating result, such as causing a patient death, it must be addressed in the course of the improvement effort. Once the cause-and-effect diagram, such as the one in Figure 4.7 which identifies possible causes of adverse drug events, has been described data would be collected on the frequency of the specific causes.

Since the Institute of Medicine report To Err Is Human (IOM, 2000) was published, the topic of medical errors and adverse events has become a priority area for customers and stakeholders of health care organizations. TJC’s review process now includes accreditation standards addressing patient safety, medical errors, and adverse events (also see Chapter 12).

Sources of Data for CQI Decisions about process performance and improvements and the application of CQI tools often start by accessing quality data in a step wise “data-to-decision cycle.” This cycle begins with data that are transformed into information, which facilitates identification of opportunities for improvement and then leads to the transformation of information into knowledge, about how to redesign processes (e.g., based on best practices). Ultimately these steps result in decisions and actions to make changes and provide feedback on the need for further improvements (e.g., in a classic PDSA cycle; McLaughlin & Kibbe, 2013). Of course, all decisions should be informed by an understanding of variation as previously defined. In defining sources of data for CQI initiatives, it is important to consider timeliness of the data being collected as well as accessibility. Most critical to this process is the quality of the data that are the input to this decision-making cycle. As with any good statistical analysis, data collected for CQI must be of the highest quality and every effort must be taken to ensure this.

No matter which tool or procedure is used to perform CQI, its findings will only be as good as the data that they are based on. The age-old acronym GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) must always be kept in mind when deciding on data sources for CQI. Ensuring the highest data quality requires the application of data standards, data management and quality assurance procedures (Loshin, 2011) to ensure that the information used to make CQI decisions is correct. Also important in ensuring data quality is proper training of team members involved in CQI initiatives (McLaughlin & Kibbe, 2013, p. 343): Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Teams may also have to depend on observers who are not team members. Management must make sure that the appropriate team members are trained to observe and record the relevant events and variables. They also should make sure that all those likely to become involved understand the CQI process and the importance of reliable data. This may also be backed up with validation of those data that are most critical in determining which alternative procedure to adopt. Two major classifications can be used to describe data that are applicable to most CQI initiatives: primary data and secondary data. Primary Data For CQI applications primary data can be defined as data that are collected specifically for the purposes of measuring process performance and improvement (i.e., providing information and knowledge about the specific practice setting or other health care environment that allows for improvement decisions to be made). The data presented in the Case Study earlier in this chapter, which were used to develop an XmR process behavior chart, are a good example of how primary data can be collected to provide knowledge and understanding about the need for process improvements.

Sampling Considerations Primary data analyses can involve collection of all available data for a fixed amount of time, as was done in the case study presented earlier, but quite often, the use of primary data is based on scientific sampling methods. In either case, a clearly defined sampling strategy is a first step. Any sampling strategy that is used should start with a clear definition of the measures to be selected and the specific sampling methodology that is to be used to select patients or subjects. Two common methodologies in health care are probability (random) sampling and judgement sampling. Also important, especially when process behavior charts involving time-series displays of data are required, is defining how often sample elements will be collected. Perla, Provost, and Murray present two important concepts, based on the previous work of CQI pioneers, Deming and Shewhart, which provide guidance for sampling in improvement projects: 1. Obtaining just enough data based on past experience to guide our learning in the future. 2. Making full use of subject matter expertise in selecting the most appropriate samples. (2013, p. 37) Following these guidelines, CQI data are often drawn from judgement or purposive samples. This differs from the types of sampling methods that are used when the goal is to make predictions or derive estimates about large populations, as is the case with probability sampling.

In process improvement studies, subject matter experts can be relied upon to choose areas, times of the day, or segments of the population to best represent the process being studied for CQI purposes. (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2013) When random sampling is being used, for example to measure patient satisfaction, the first step is to carefully identify the sampling frame, defined as the source of data for the key elements that are to be analyzed and from which a sample is to be taken in order to make inferences about the larger population of interest, such as the medical care database from the institution whose quality we are assessing. Also critical to successful sampling strategies is careful determination of sample size. Sample size is always important because it plays a role in determining precision of estimates of quality metrics and also directly affects study cost estimates (Levy & Lemeshow, 2008). Also important in probability sampling is estimating the prevalence of the measures being studied: Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Our experience is that the first thing that often happens is that the designers overestimate the prevalence of the phenomenon being studied and hence underestimate the cost of finding enough affected individuals. When the recruitment of participants lags, the perception that the budget is fixed leads to a reduction in those cases surveyed, often jeopardizing what conclusions might be reached. The team must test those prevalence assumptions early on and plan realistically; one of the ways this can be accomplished is through the use of smaller “pilot” studies prior to carrying out the final survey. Inter-organizational access to data could make the task of assessing prevalence much easier as well. (McLaughlin & Kibbe, 2013, p. 346) Whether probability or judgement sampling is used to select primary data an important data quality concern is consideration of “non-sampling” errors (those that cannot be controlled by traditional sample design and statistical analysis adjustments). One very important example of this type of error that is quite prevalent in health care surveys, such as those used to measure patient satisfaction, is non-response (i.e., when the number who respond to a survey is smaller than the number selected to be studies). High levels of non-response can lead to selection bias and underrepresentation of the patients intended to be surveyed, sometimes also compromising the power of any statistical or process behavior analysis to be carried out based on these data. Quite simply, if a sample of patients is selected, and patients are contacted to provide feedback on patient care they have received, the data derived from such a survey will only be useful if a high response rate is obtained. This fact is true for all types of scientific surveys, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care.

Measuring patient satisfaction is an important way to ensure a customer focus, a basic tenet of CQI in health care, and such efforts are to be applauded. But two key factors to pay close attention to in these efforts to measure patient satisfaction are adequacy of sample size and consideration/control of nonresponse. For example, Wake Forest Baptist Hospital in North Carolina, which has earned a “Press Ganey Seal of Integrity” reports that the patient survey results in their organization are based on a random selection of outpatients who receive questionnaires via regular mail or email within a few weeks of their appointments. They also report that the target sample size for computing individual provider ratings is 30, and that the average response rate is 18%, which varies by specialty. Results are posted on-line as part of provider profiles, unless fewer than 30 responses are received, in which case it is the provider’s choice as to whether results will be posted. One reason given for this procedure is that it is recognized that smaller sample sizes will lead to high variability in ratings due to extreme values (Wake Forest– Baptist Health, 2016). It may be assumed that this survey process and these numbers are similar for other large hospital systems. A first step to consider when evaluating the knowledge gained from such a survey process, especially for CQI, is to determine whether the response rate is sufficient to make quality of care decisions. While a target of 100% response is a goal, it is not achievable in most cases, so the question remains: What is an acceptable response rate? The answer to this question will vary depending on Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC.

For example, if survey response rates are considered to be inadequate, then a cause-and-effect analysis may be considered as a way to understand and increase response rates. Also important to consider are other forms of non-response, such as selective responses, which may not be representative of true patient satisfaction—for example, if those who do respond had an extreme experience, whether superb or terrible. In addition to response rate issues sample size must also be considered before making decisions related to quality of care. For example, when target sample sizes are not achieved, unacceptably high margins of error may invalidate conclusions based on survey data and especially comparisons over time or between departments or providers (Zusman, 2012). Decisions based on patient survey results also require careful consideration of the limits of the data and possible confounding factors that may influence findings; for example, there have been reports of physicians’ employment and income being threatened based on poor satisfaction scores and some assertions that patient satisfaction scoring actually leads to poorer quality of care due to some providers altering medical treatment to influence patient satisfaction scores (Zusman, 2012). These examples underline how important it is important to consider both the source of the data being collected in measuring quality and also how the results are used; attention to detail on both extremes—data collection and decision making—is critical. Despite some criticism of patient satisfaction surveys, their use is increasing, which creates opportunities for continuous improvement. There is a current trend to increase the use of patient satisfaction and spurred by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other legislation attempts to Johnson, J.

The key point to be taken from this discussion is not to demean the efforts of measuring patient satisfaction; but in the same way that process improvement actions should only be taken when there is evidence of special cause variation, the same advice applies to only taking action based on surveys of (patients or providers) when data sources are proven to be reliable and high quality and are sufficient to support the level of decisions to which they are being applied. It is important for those who make use of survey data to carefully consider the basic principles of measurement and understanding variation before taking actions and whenever possible use knowledge gained to improve processes, including survey methodology processes. Secondary Data Secondary data are data that are collected for purposes other than the specific process performance or improvement initiative that is of interest. Especially with the broad availability of data that can be accessed via the internet and with a proper investment in Health Information Technology (HIT) secondary data have become and will continue to be very useful for carrying out CQI initiatives. Secondary data sources that can support CQI include data registries and claims data. One rich source of claims data represents information available as part of the Medicare program, administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS; McLaughlin & Kibbe, 2013).

This 95-bed, family-owned nursing home, located in the foothills of North Carolina, was attempting to reduce restraint use in its facility. Clemson received an invitation from the state QIO to participate in a restraint-reduction quality improvement initiative. Using data from all nursing homes in the state (available through the CMS “Minimum Data Set (MDS)” reporting system), the QIO provided Clemson with graphs illustrating that its restraint use was higher than the state and national averages, ranking them as having the fourth highest restraint use rate among nursing homes in the initiative. Working with the QIO, Clemson conducted a root-cause analysis (Ross, 2014) and identified several opportunities for reducing restraints. Testing new processes using PDSA cycles over a period of several weeks, Clemson was able to reduce restraint use from 10% to 6% and ultimately achieved its goal of 3% by the end of the initiative (Schenck, McArdle, & Weiser, 2013, p. 435).

Electronic Health Records An important source of secondary data that is being used more frequently to carry out CQI studies is electronic health records (EHR). Over 90% of hospitals and physician practices now have some form of EHR systems in place. The ubiquity of EHRs is Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

ARRA established incentive payments to promote the adoption and meaningful use of interoperable HIT and EHRs. Beginning in 2011, the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Programs were established to encourage eligible professionals and eligible hospitals to adopt, implement, upgrade (AIU), and demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Meaningful use is using certified EHR technology to: ■ Improve quality, safety, efficiency, and reduce health disparities ■ Engage patients and family ■ Improve care coordination, and population and public health ■ Maintain privacy and security of patient health information Meaningful Use was implemented in 3 stages. ■ Stage 1 (2011–2012) set the foundation for the EHR Incentive Programs by establishing requirements for the electronic capture of clinical data, including providing patients with electronic copies of health information. ■ Stage 2 (2014) expanded upon the Stage 1 criteria with a focus on ensuring that the meaningful use of EHRs supported the aims and priorities of the National Quality Strategy. Stage 2 criteria encouraged the use of HIT for CQI at the point of care and the exchange of information in the most structured format possible. ■ In October 2015, CMS released a final rule that specifies criteria that eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) must meet in","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 4 - Understanding Variation, Tools, and Data Sources for CQI in Health Care_53"}}],["705",{"pageContent":"at the point of care and the exchange of information in the most structured format possible. ■ In October 2015, CMS released a final rule that specifies criteria that eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) must meet in order to participate in the EHR Incentive Programs in 2015 through 2017 (Modified Stage 2) and in Stage 3 in 2017 and beyond (CDC, 2017; CMS, 2017a; CMS, 2015a).

CMS has also provided guidance on the choice and use of clinical measures in EHRs through the definition of clinical quality measures (CQMs) that can be used to carry out CQI. CQMs are tools that help measure and track the quality of health care services provided by eligible professionals, eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) within our health care system. These measures use data associated with providers’ ability to deliver high-quality care or relate to long term goals for quality health care. CQMs measure many aspects of patient care including: ■ health outcomes ■ clinical processes ■ patient safety ■ efficient use of health care resources ■ care coordination ■ patient engagements ■ population and public health ■ adherence to clinical guidelines (CMS, 2015b; 2017b). Ultimately, it is hoped that the meaningful use compliance and the use of CQMs will result in better clinical outcomes, improved population health outcomes, increased transparency and efficiency, empowered individuals and more robust research data on health systems. Most recently, the widespread use of EHRs provides a new source of secondary data that has many useful characteristics for CQI applications, especially in large health systems where direct access to patient data via primary data collection methods may be costly or infeasible for other reasons.

Copyright © 2018. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. EHR systems can be very useful especially in large health care systems, because of features such as interoperability, linking patient care across multiple institutions, and the ability to capture details of interactions between providers and patients with linkages to various forms of health indicators (e.g., laboratory results). However, it is most important to recognize that most EHR systems were not designed for the purpose of carrying out detailed analyses required for CQI tools and techniques and although they may include predefined metrics and summaries via “dashboards” these data may not provide the level of specificity needed to meet specific process measurement and improvement requirements. Once again, we advise that wherever CQI studies are not based on primary data collected for the specific purposes of the process evaluation/improvement study of interest, caution must be applied to understand knowledge gained and specifically sources of variation before taking actions.

Conclusions This chapter described the importance of measurement concepts in CQI. Most important is understanding variation and, in particular, understanding the distinction between special and common causes of variation and how this understanding determines the most appropriate action for improvement. It has been illustrated that the most effective way to understand process variation is to plot data over time, preferably, on a control chart/process behavior chart. Once the appropriate improvement strategy is determined, then the use of CQI tools described here together with other methodologies described in this text (e.g., PDSA, is recommended). A case study designed to facilitate classroom discussion and published data examples have been presented to illustrate the application of these methodologies.

H CHAPTER 5 Lean and Six Sigma Management: Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics Ed Popovich, Hal Wiggin, and Paul Barach The ultimate arrogance is to change the way people work, without changing the way we manage them. — John Toussaint igh-performing health care organizations differentiate themselves by focusing relentlessly on improving their service and performance and are guided by process-improvement initiatives to advance patient care. Continuous quality improvement offers a powerful way of thinking about how to transform clinical operations and health care teams. Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI), Lean Management Systems (LMS), and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) are philosophies and methods for leadership, management, improvement, and innovation. They offer an approach, a set of tools, and a way of thinking about how to more effectively study, assess, and improve clinical flow, including addressing and reducing variations in processes and operations. LMS and LSS are also broadly generalizable to other health applications such as public health (see Chapter 11) and a broad array of settings, including applying CQI in resource poor countries (see Chapter 13).

Lean and Six Sigma Management Defined Six Sigma, as its name implies (sigma being the Greek symbol used in statistics to measure variation), utilizes statistical methods to identify and reduce variation in processes (Duffy, Farmer, & Moran, 2009). (See Chapter 4 for a detailed description of types and causes of variability.) In 1986, when Motorola originated and launched the continuous improvement and innovation effort they called Six Sigma, it was an evolution of quality methods that originated in in the United States and Japan that then further developed at Motorola. The U.S. and Japanese quality leaders, followed by other companies, learned from each other as they further evolved systems of quality management. Ford Motor Company developed mass production systems that Toyota developed further into the Toyota Production System (TPS) through their emphasis on elimination of waste, which they termed muda, muri, and mura (Muda, muri, mura— Toyota production system guide, 2013).

Muda: Wasting Resources Muda is the waste due to nonvalue-added activities, which was translated back by companies in the United States as elimination of waste in the use of seven resources: transportation, inventory, motion during production, waiting time spent during production, over-processing (by doing more than necessary), over-production (by producing more products or items than needed), and defects, such as producing faulty parts or making mistakes in the process. Often, the focus of the Lean Management System (LMS) in health care is reducing muda, especially with respect to waiting time experienced by patients, mistakes or “near misses” in patient care, transitions in patient care due to transportation and/or motion in moving patients between","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 5 - Lean and Six Sigma Management - Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 5 - Lean and Six Sigma Management - Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 5 - Lean and Six Sigma Management - Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics_1"}}],["718",{"pageContent":"the Lean Management System (LMS) in health care is reducing muda, especially with respect to waiting time experienced by patients, mistakes or “near misses” in patient care, transitions in patient care due to transportation and/or motion in moving patients between care providers or services, and managing inventory of equipment and supplies. Thus, examples of waste in health care include wasted inventory, rework, excess waiting time —whether by patients or staff members who need results of another provider’s inputs to make decisions—lost time, errors, or extra work associated with poor processing of information or outdated procedures, and waste from transporting patients unnecessarily (Spath & Kelly, 2017). Muri: Overburdening Staff and Equipment Muri is the waste due to over-burdening the people or equipment in the process, as processes that are balanced are desirable. Lessthan-optimal attention paid to muri in health care often is evident when physicians and staff feel overwhelmed with the level of effort required for them to provide patient care, document the care provided, address regulatory reporting requirements, attend required meetings, and provide all the support beyond the effort required for patient care. Burnout is experienced by many physicians and health care providers. Improving the balance of processes is an imperative in patient care delivery. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Mura is the reason for the development of “just-in-time” production systems so that the process flow is more predictable and consistent. In health care, the desire to “get things off your plate” and send it to the next function in the process is common. In other words, rather than providing each person what is needed at the time it is needed, there is a tendency to batch up work and then send it in “one pile” to the next step in the process. Examples include batch reading of radiology exams rather than reading the exam at the time the patient is present and providing the results for each individual patient as they progress their patient care process.

Morning blood draws in an acute care setting are another example, as the blood is drawn and sent to pathology in batches to do the analyses. How Six Sigma Originated Motorola was very much aware of the quality methodology practiced in Japan, including just-in-time processing, POKA-YOKE (“fool-proofing processes”), process simplification, and continuous improvement by all staff (Harry, 1998). They observed that efficient and effective process flow through the elimination or reduction of nonvalued-added processing could not only reduce the number of errors or defects in production, but it also could increase the consistency of performance of the process. Motorola decided to select skilled staff with technical backgrounds and train them in advanced quality, engineering, manufacturing, and statistical methodology, which in turn facilitated their ability to improve or innovate the design of both their products and work processes. Motorola established two improvement goals as part of what they defined as their Total Customer Satisfaction (TCS) strategy: 1. All defects were to be reduced 10-fold every 2 years, which implies a 68% improvement per year. For example, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Note that in the 2 years, the failure rate would be expected to drop from 10% to 1%, which is a 10-fold improvement. 2. All core processes must reduce their cycle time (lead time) by 50% within 2 years. To achieve these goals, Motorola recognized that: ■ Variation in process performance can lead to greater defect/error rates.

Therefore, a reduction in process variation can induce a lower rate of defects, where a defect was defined as the failure of a process to achieve its goals. ■ Speeding up processes requires the elimination of unnecessary (e.g., nonvalue- added) tasks or steps since simply doing the same steps faster in order to achieve a 50% reduction in cycle time often will drive more defects while overwhelming workers and which violates the simultaneous goal of a reduction in defect rates. In 1990, the term “Lean Production” received attention due to the book The Machine That Changed the World by James Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos. The authors explained that mass production systems emanating from Toyota via Ford and other companies were evolving into a coherent narrative that enabled systems requiring less time for production, less effort from people, lower inventories of supplies, and less capital investment. Remarkably, this new system of work could yield fewer defects, yet it was able to better mass customize by serving smaller and smaller market sizes at lower costs. In 1996, Womack & Jones published Lean Thinking, which distilled the LMS theory into five principles: 1. The customer defines value. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Organizations should make the product (or, in health care, management of the patient’s care) flow through the steps of the value- added process continuously. 4. Organizations need subsequent steps in the process that “pull” products (or patients) from the previous steps rather than push them forward, causing them to batch up waiting for the next step. 5. Organizations should work to continuously improve in order to reduce steps, time, costs, and the information (data) needed to serve the customer (again, the patient in our case; Anthony, Palsuk, Gupta, Mishra,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 5 - Lean and Six Sigma Management - Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 5 - Lean and Six Sigma Management - Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 5 - Lean and Six Sigma Management - Building a Foundation for Optimal Patient Care Using Patient Flow Physics_4"}}],["721",{"pageContent":"5.

It was not until the later 1990s that consultants decided to call the time-based techniques “Lean,” although these methods had already been incorporated into Motorola’s two simultaneous goals of the Six Sigma program. The more technical analyses that incorporated variation and defect reduction were called Six Sigma by many, rather than the more encompassing meaning behind Six Sigma as envisioned by Motorola. Motorola viewed what later became called LMS and Six Sigma as separate management activities that were “two sides of the same coin,” which they simply called Six Sigma. For example, having fewer steps to accomplish the same process leads to fewer steps in which to make errors, less variation across the process, and ultimately to better, cheaper, and faster processes. Michael George is one of the people credited with popularizing the term “Lean Six Sigma.” Acknowledging this “two sides of the same coin,” he wrote (George, 2002, p. 7): Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. Created from westerngovernors-ebooks on 2023-04-25 02:13:31. Copyright © 2018. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that maximizes shareholder value by achieving the fastest rate of customer satisfaction, cost, quality, process speed, and invested capital. The fusion of LMS and Six Sigma is required because: ■ LMS cannot bring a process under statistical control. ■ Six Sigma alone cannot dramatically improve process speed or reduce invested capital. Thomas L. Jackson and Karen R. Jones note that organizations cannot incorporate a LMS overnight. More specifically (Jackson & Jones, 1996, pp. 7–8), To support lean production, management must build, nurture, and support the logic and machinery that drives lean production.

This system reflects the principles and methodologies of leading international managers and consultants. “Lean Six Sigma” (LSS) adoption in health care and public health represents an evolution resulting in part from alliances and interchanges with corporate and government partners, and it promoted the evolution of CQI across several industries (Duffy, Farmer, & Moran, 2009).

The following sections of this chapter will define these methodologies in greater detail by describing their use in health care settings and, in particular, by illustrating patient flow LMS applications. Patient Flow as an Application of LSS Organizations that focus on improving value-added activities can develop a strategic and competitive advantage (Byrne, 2013, p. xi). Improving process “flow” is one of the primary goals of LSS and CQI. A value stream or process with optimum flow would be analogous to a river that cascades over a cliff and rages through a narrow gorge, flowing downhill with no bends, rocks, or other impediments. This is akin to a clinic with high patient flow and demand that has the right number of highly skilled staff working with patients to meet their care needs using well-designed processes that have minimal waste (Sanchez & Barach, 2012). Staff are patient-focused leaders who manage with the “right” data, and they empower staff to continuously improve the workplace as they deliver exceptional care.

With the advent of the 21st century, there have been discernable improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of care in some settings, including broader applications of what has been called the Triple Aim of Health Care: improving (1) the experience of care and (2) population health while (3) reducing costs (Berwick, Nolan, & Whittington, 2008). However, despite this progress, patients still experience unacceptable harm; processes are not as efficient as they could be; and costs continue to rise at alarming rates, while quality issues remain. The key to ensuring CQI in health care organizations is changing organizational culture, as discussed in Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Organizations seeking to be efficient and effective in care delivery need to embed a culture that identifies wasteful effort, seek ways to continually improve existing processes, and design processes for those that do not currently exist in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness in meeting their outcomes with no wasted effort. Womack and Jones correctly observed that “…patients often discover that the time spent on treatment was a tiny fraction of the time you spent going through the “process.” Mostly you were sitting and waiting (“patient” is clearly the right word), or moving about to the next step in the diagnosis and treatment…” (2003, p. 50). If waiting is a nonvalue-adding activity, why do most health care facilities incorporate a formal “waiting” room into their care delivery processes? When flow is attained and information, materials, and activity proceed seamlessly through processes without interruption, then optimal experiences can occur. This is more likely to happen if leaders ensure “rules that require the learning of skills, they set up goals, they provide feedback, and they make control possible. They facilitate concentration and involvement by making the activity as distinct as possible from the so-called paramount reality of everyday existence” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990, p. 72).

Applying LSS to Patient Flow in Community Hospital Emergency Department In 2004, one of the authors (EP) was a Vice President for Enterprise Excellence (outside health care, this position is often termed an operational excellence leader) at a non-profit private hospital, where he sought to improve both the patient flow in the ED and the women’s mammography service lines. The hospital was located in a wealthy south Florida community that supported the hospital through a large foundation. The board was concerned about reports from some wealthy benefactors that the waiting times to see a physician in the ED were too long. EDs are often called the “front door” to the hospital, in that approximately 65% of patients admitted to the hospital arrive via the ED. Long wait times at various times of the day in the ED lead to patient and family dissatisfaction, frustration by staff and the community, and in turn may lead to reducing charitable donations to a hospital foundation.

Factory Physics describes the “laws” that govern patient process flow much like physics is a science describing the “laws” that govern the forces on physical materials in our world. Factory Physics modeling was used to improve the understanding of patient flow through the ED from the time the physician first encountered the patient until a decision was made as to whether to discharge the patient to go home (“treat-to-street” cycle time) or to admit the patient to the hospital (“doctor-to-decision” cycle time). In addition, the time between when a decision was made until the patient left the ED to go home or was moved to an in-patient room was termed the “decision-to-disposition” cycle time.

Figure 5.1 shows a box plot of patient arrivals to this community hospital by the hour of the day. Each box has a median line in the box that represents the 50th percentile (median) number of arrivals for each hour. The bottom of the box represents the 25th percentile, and the top of the box represents the 75th percentile of patient arrivals each hour. The distant points (outliers) outside the box represent the range of patient arrivals each hour, with those points that are larger than the top of the lines extending from each box representing outliers in the number of patient arrivals that seldom occur but were observed over the period of 2002–2005. Distinct, daily patterns in patient arrivals were discovered, i.e., days of the week had hourly arrival patterns that were similar from week to week. Knowing the demand patterns helps a health care administrator be better prepared to address the demand. Some of the emerging questions included: 1. How does this demand pattern support decisions and lead to more effective staffing up- and downstream? 2. What are the optimal levels of staffing to meet patient demand? 3. Does the nature of the demand vary over the course of the day? 4. Are there certain “chief complaints” or issues that are seen more often during a certain time of the day or on particular days of the week? 5. Does the type of staff skills needed differ at various times of the day or on certain days of the week? 6. What should the organization do, if anything, to be prepared to handle the variation and demand outliers including during mass casualty or pandemic events? Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

If the organization is only staffed for the median hourly demand, then 50% of the time, the demand will be greater than expected. This can contribute to increased waiting times and dissatisfaction by patients that choose to stay and wait. Of course, some patients may choose to leave and go elsewhere rather than wait, which may lead to increased patient risk and lowered facility revenue and may undermine the organization’s reputation. Further, the study of time, day, and primary clinical issues of patients that were admitted yielded information about the demand on each floor and unit of the hospital. For example, often hospitals have rules for discharging patients (e.g., all patients going home on a certain day are to be discharged by 2 PM). Unfortunately, the data indicated that the demand for beds within the hospital from patients admitted by the ED did not synchronize with the 2 PM discharge goal. Therefore, some units had patients in beds who were not discharged by 2 PM, although there was a need for these beds to relieve the congestion in the ED. The Patient Flow Physics model predicted the number of beds that were likely to be needed by each unit, stratified by both the day of the week and the time of the day. Knowing the demand requirements for beds in advance allowed each floor to identify the patients most likely to go home each day and determine which patients were likely to be discharged by each hour to meet the bed needs of the ED. Simply put, if the flow out of each unit at least closely approximates the flow into each unit by day of the week and time of day, then there should be less back-up of patients in the ED. In turn, this allows patients to flow smoothly into and out of the ED. Incorporating process and flow data can facilitate effective handling of patient demand, utilization of resources such as staff skills, and provide input as to where process improvements can be applied to reduce waiting time, poor staff utilization, and other wasteful aspects.

Applying LSS to Patient Flow in Community Hospital Mammography Service The women’s mammography service line at the hospital also benefited significantly. At the beginning of the effort, the women who started their diagnostic journey with a self-referral mammography and were diagnosed with cancer would find, on average, that it took 8 weeks to move through the diagnostic journey (e.g., screening, focused mammography views, ultrasound, biopsy, MRI) to treatment, which may include radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. The journey was reduced to one week or less after detailed assessment of the process and utilization of LSS. The significance of this improvement cannot be understated: The earlier cancer is identified and treatment begun, the greater the chance for improved clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and overall quality of life (Viau & Southern, 2007). The Patient Flow Physics Framework The Patient Flow Physics framework provides a performance model that describes how items (patients and information) flow through a patient care process. This framework can help improve the control and predictability of health care operation service lines. This framework recognizes that all processes consist of: 1. Demand 2. Transformation 3. Inventory Demand is the rate at which patients present to the patient-care organization. Transformation is the activity that converts sick patients into healthy ones or, at least, brings wellness from illness or injury. Inventory consists of both the supplies used for treating Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care.

Because the health care network consists of interconnected elements, one must be able to characterize and manage patient flows in three different arenas: 1. Flow into the patient care process (e.g., ED or out-patient clinic); 2. Flow through the patient care process; and 3. Flow out of the patient care process. Whether the flow is smooth or chaotic, fast or slow, restricted or unrestricted, depends on a range of factors internal as well as external to the patient care process. Patient flow into the ED is a consequence of patient flows from emergency medical services, nursing homes, transfers from other hospitals, direct patient admits (referrals by outside physicians), and walk-in patients. The patterns and sources of patient arrivals are very important because they critically influence the queuing effects on the input side of the ED or, in general, of any patient-care process. Understanding the patterns and sources can sometimes allow better management of demand. For example, EDs can choose to divert patients from emergency medical services to other EDs. Also, EDs are often utilized by outside physicians to directly admit patients to a hospital in-patient setting. Why does this happen? Referring physicians recognize that their patients will have tests associated with admission carried out without delay (“stat” orders) in the ED, meaning they are prioritized and completed as soon as possible, versus the expected delays by going to the ambulatory clinic. Therefore, EDs could better work with outside physicians to schedule these direct patient admits for less busy times of the day, thus reducing demand during peak demand times and improving relationships with community providers.

Patient flow through the ED is a function of ED resource utilization and the variability associated with differences between ED providers. Utilization of ED providers is of high concern. These providers include physicians (MDs and DOs), physician assistants (PAs), and nurse practitioners (NPs). Another key resource that often serves as a constraint in EDs are the ED beds. Whenever an ED requires each new patient to be seen in an ED bed, patients may be waiting longer to be seen when beds are filled with patients. Some EDs have recognized that having ED beds as a constraint can be overcome through seeing patients in areas without beds where they can be assessed and treated rapidly (FitzGerald, Jelinek, Scott, & Gerdtz, 2009). The three-part series published in 2013–2014 called Cracking the Code: Fixing the Crowded Emergency Department, written by Dr. Joseph Guarisco, Chair of Emergency Services at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans, captures many of the ideas. The Ochsner Health System uses qTrack for “quick sorting” of patients, which protects ED beds from being over-utilized. Some ED professionals will invoke the rule of thumb that “vertical patients should remain vertical, while horizontal patients should remain horizontal,” meaning that those patients who can walk in are vertical and are often able to be treated while standing or sitting. The patients who arrive via emergency medical transport (EMT) are often in a stretcher and should remain lying down on a bed. Patient flow out of the ED is crucial to avoid overly long stays in the ED. The patients who are admitted to the hospital yet are “blocked” from being transported to in-patient units will remain in the ED until an in-patient unit can accept the patient. These patients are referred to as “ED boarded” patients. The reason ED boarding arises may be due to a lack of transport personnel, unavailability of consulting physicians (consults), and insufficient beds (either in the Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A.

Patient flow out of the ED is an issue during winter seasons when demand is greatest; for example, during the winter in Florida, there is often a significant increase in part-time residents and visitors, which may lead to an increase in in-patient census. Cycle times through a care process can depend upon flow through and out of a care process. This, of course, can be influenced by the design of the care process. For example, whether processes are arranged in series or in parallel, and whether process steps serve a useful function or exist merely because of tradition and organizational legacy. Patient Flow and the VUT Equation Patient flow through and out of a patient care process is often the focus of clinical operations. The flow into patient care processes is impacted by the demand that operations try to manage. The flow through patient care processes is impacted by the utilization of key resources (e.g., staffing levels, providers available, and room availability) to keep patients flowing smoothly through the care processes. The flow out of patient care processes is impacted by both internal resources and readiness of resources outside of the current patient care process. For example, it is more difficult to discharge some older patients if there are not enough skilled nursing facilities (SNF) in the community. Likewise, limited behavioral health program options impact the release of patients needing those services. In their book Factory Physics: Foundations of Manufacturing Management, Hopp & Spearman (2008), provide the “laws that govern process flow” in manufacturing systems.

BOX 5.1 VUT Equation Average Patient Flow Care Time = Variation (V) × Utilization (U) × Process Time (T) It is sufficient for our discussion to understand that anything that increases the variation (V), increases resource utilization (U), or operates in processes that are designed to take a long time (T) leads to increases in average patient flow care time. In other words, to reduce the overall cycle time in the care of patients requires efforts to reduce the variation in the clinical processes, reduce utilization of key resources (e.g., having extra capacity in terms of resources), and optimize the inherent process design to eliminate wasted time.

Special cause variation is not random, and it can be assigned to special events or circumstances such as with extremely high patient count in an ED due to a major, mass casualty event. It could also be attributed to an increase in medical errors due to new equipment failures. Causes of variation in data can be detected with control charts, which are run charts (or time series graphs) that incorporate upper and lower control (sigma) lines (see Chapter 4 and examples later in the chapter). There are eight universally accepted decision rules that are applied to detect extreme points from the mean, trends, and the unusual patterns that are low probability events. Wheeler (2000) prefers the name process behavior charts because it better describes the variation as the “voice of the process.” These charts can help distinguish between routine, always occurring “noise” vs. “signals” that are hopefully less frequent indications of some special cause variation. Finally, data and variation can only be understood in the context in which they were collected (Hesselink et al., 2013). More specifically, the analysis must be applied to a specific process; individual or group; period of time; or the use of Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Control charts must use rational sampling and rational subgrouping to produce valid results (Wheeler, 1995). Selection of the time and data must be consistent and based on logic. When data collection is properly conducted, the three sigma limits and within-group variation will help identify legitimate process “signals.” The goal of rational subgrouping is to identify differences between short- and longer-term process variation at single points in time. The variables that effect variation are random if there were no deliberate changes to the process.

Natural variation is commonly occurring and due to chance, bias, or an artifact in data collection. Variation is natural and it is going to happen. It cannot be eliminated but it can be managed. On the other hand, artificial variation “is neither necessary nor random. It is driven by largely unknown, ignored, or unchallenged priorities.” It is like the self-inflicted wound of scheduling elective surgeries during busy, prime hours.

We have found the following observations about managing variation to be helpful. Learn the patterns of demand. Although demand of clinical processes can vary significantly from day to day or within a day, there are tools, including run charts, control charts, and box plots, that can lead to a better understanding of demand variation in terms of when it may occur and how much variation it can cause. For example, grocery stores use forecasts to manage inventory along with staffing matched to demand.

Clinical practice variation can be addressed through some form of standardization as discussed later in this chapter in LMS practices. Health care systems often use standard order sets to address the 80/20 rule, where 80% of the patients presenting with known conditions can be handled with a basic order set. For example, although patients that visit an ED may be unique, experienced providers will recognize that most of these patients present a similar patient pattern, and standard order sets can be used effectively. The care for these “typical” patients will therefore be more consistent and standardized. The patients presenting with unusual conditions or an unusual manifestation of these conditions can then be addressed with extra attention or with different procedures. Standardization of activities is also an effective way to reduce variation by ensuring that staff perform the same duties in the same preferred ways. Only best practices are standardized so this also increases quality. According to Imai (2012, pp. 54–55), “standards represent the best, easiest, and safest way to do a job.” They also preserve organizational knowledge and expertise and facilitate valid measurement of organizational performance.

Learn from other organizations dealing with high variability. High-reliability organizations (HROs) have characteristics that parallel many features of the health care environments (i.e., EDs, operating rooms, intensive care units, etc.), including the use of complex technologies, a fast-paced tempo of operations, and a high level of risk, yet they manifest spectacularly low error rates (Sanchez & Barach, 2012). HROs are required to respond to a wide variety of situations under changing environmental conditions in a reliable and consistent way. Examples of HROs include aircraft carriers, nuclear power plants, and firefighting teams. Weick and Sutcliffe (2001) have studied these industries and found that they share an extraordinary capacity to discover and manage unexpected events resulting in exceptional safety and consistent levels of performance despite a fast-changing external environment. HRO methodologies and practices can offer clinical care with greater patient safety, less process rework, improved patient outcomes, and greater patient satisfaction (Oster & Braaten, 2016; Tamuz & Harrison, 2006).

Copyright © 2018. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. Create buffers. Buffer management is an effective approach for reducing and mitigating the negative aspects of excessive and/or uncontrolled variation. Buffers are like shock absorbers on cars. Instead of reducing bumps in the road for a car, buffers reduce or dampen the effect of variability when trying to synchronize demand to transformation (Pound, Bell, & Spearman, 2014, p. 51). There are time, capacity, and inventory buffers. Time buffers include waiting times and extra available time that can be used. Capacity buffers are the numbers of staff, beds, and equipment that can be used to treat patients. Inventory buffers can be supplies or patients’ waiting for the next step in a process. Buffers must be properly managed, and they cannot be too large. Patients do not like to wait and unused capacity and inventory costs money. The creative use of buffers can greatly reduce patient length of stay. A family practitioner liked to spend extra time with certain patients to socialize. Unfortunately, this usually altered the carefully constructed patient schedule. He did not want to give up this “special” time so it was suggested that he see those patients just before his lunch break or at the end of the day. It proved an effective compromise. Utilization Utilization refers to the use of resources. Utilization without any waste or nonvalue-added activities is an “efficient” process (see the previous Muri discussion). These resources are more technically referred to as “capacity.” Utilization is impacted by: ■ Available staffing capacity each hour to handle variation in demand ■ Availability of resources such as computer systems, beds/treatment rooms, equipment in imaging/labs, and transportation Johnson, J.

FIGURE 5.2 Generic High-Level Health Care Value Stream When the population does not have adequate and effective prevention services, they can develop serious health conditions that require secondary or tertiary treatment. Families without health insurance tend to use more expensive ED services because they cannot access ambulatory and out-patient care. A lack of in-patient beds contributes to ED boarding, as does limited availabilty of SNFs. Inadequate staffing levels adds to length of stay and decreases the quality of patient care. Both under and overutilization of resources can be problematic. Capacity issues, poor process design, and/or unsatisfactory staff performance contribute to process bottlenecks which are the slowest activity steps. One way to address capacity is to build in “slack” as “a cushion of actual or potential resources which allows an organization to adapt successfully to internal pressures for adjustment or to external pressures for change in policy as well as to initiate changes in strategy…” (Lawson, 2001, pp. 125–131).

Experienced hospital executives know that ED boarding tends to increase when in-patient bed usage exceeds 80%. The Toyota Production System (TPS) has been the very effective model for many LMS turnaround initiatives in hospitals systems like Virginia Mason (Kenney, 2010). TPS frees up time for quality by empowering workers to “fix” errors when they occur, even if it slows down or stops “the line.” They have lower manager- and supervisor-to-staff ratios, which aids in problem solving and coaching. They also take more time to plan new products and services to “get it right,” thus saving significant resources before production and delivery commences. There are many ways to keep utilization of key resources low: 1. Keeping key resources such as providers and beds in an ED utilized less than 80% of the time allows for better management of demand and enables the system to address more effectively variation in patient flow (see Muri discussed previously); 2. Understanding variation in demand and patients will allow for better scheduling of people resources (see Mura discussed previously); and 3. Applying box plots of variation as explained earlier in this chapter allows for determining the 75th percentile of demand and process variation so that adjusting scheduling to meet the demands of the 75th percentile will lessen the impact of overall process demand and minimize flow variation.

Slow and inefficient health care processes negatively impact patient satisfaction. Management dictates that “time is money.” More importantly, slow treatment can contribute to poor health outcomes. Time includes the activities or tasks within each step and the space between steps. Delays can occur during handoffs and transitions; departmental or functional group boundaries can also contribute to these “white space” management challenges (Rummler & Brache, 1995).

The cancer screening mammography example discussed earlier in the chapter illustrates the impact that the passing time has on the effectiveness of the process. Each step in the diagnostic journey for cancer screening (e.g., initial screening, additional digital imaging, ultrasound, MRI, biopsy, surgical treatment, oncological treatment) may be well-defined and managed. However, the time between steps may be increased due to the unplanned or poorly managed transitions between each step. If an initial screening mammography is completed and no “suspicious” areas of the breast are observed, then the process may stop. If a suspicious area in the mammography is observed, then the provider may either ask the patient to stay longer for additional imaging or, for those providers who do not read the initial imaging in real time while the patient is there, the patient’s primary care physician may receive a report later indicating more work-up is needed. The patient is contacted and requested to make an appointment for a follow-up visit with either the primary care physician or the mammography center, or both. Therefore, the transition from initial screening imaging and follow-up imaging may have wait times built in that can increase patient anxiety. Furthermore, delay may allow time for ongoing growth of a cancerous tumor. In 1915, Gilbreth used time motion studies to show convincingly that the actual time needed to complete a process, such as imaging, reading the results, and determining the next clinical steps, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. Created from westerngovernors-ebooks on 2023-04-25 02:13:31.

Reducing transition time between steps (i.e., eliminating wait time) is often worthwhile in reducing patient anxiety, determining clinical concerns earlier, perhaps reducing the effort needed for treatment if caught earlier, and honoring the patient’s personal time.

Putting the patient first (beyond paying lip service) takes significant effort and may be a challenge to the “way things are done here.” Time is also defined by the process: ■ The design of a patient care process can determine the minimal amount of time a patient will spend, flow through, and out of a process if there were no impediments or variation in the process. ■ Addition of nonvalue-added steps in the process that only adds time, potentially increases variation, and increased opportunity for errors. For example, in an empty ED, are all patients required to go through a separate step called “triage,” or can they immediately proceed directly to being seen by a provider? We have learned by managing dozens of clinical projects that finding ways to reduce the length of time spent in the patient flow care process may require staff to: 1. Eliminate or reduce nonvalue- added process tasks or steps such as unnecessary waiting times. The longer the process, the more things can go wrong for patients and the more costs for the system. 2. Implement LMS (see discussion that follows) to draw attention to time spent on identifying and reducing nonvalue-added process steps. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

This reduces boundary or interface issues. It is not coincidental that the philosophies and practices of CQI as espoused by Six Sigma, LMS, and LSS, all lead to reducing variation in processes and overutilization of resources as well as streamlining patient flow care processes, leading to reduced time to care.

Lean Management System (LMS) The VUT equation described is a relatively simple model to understand, but it is more challenging to implement. LMS models provide for an effective system to optimize process management as suggested by the VUT equation. The active joining of these two models will be discussed later. Specifically, managers and their staff need to direct and set examples about required behaviors to reduce or manage variation, maximize human and equipment utilization, and decrease process cycle times. First, a comparison is in order. If a Lean organization is like an automobile, then the engine is similar to the organization’s capacity to provide services and the transmission is anologous to a LMS. The transmission sends power to the wheel axel to move the vehicle forward. It also changes gears to better match power and resource demands. An automatic transmission smooths these shifts and helps reduce variation. An organization’s LMS coordinates resources and directs them to efficiently satisfy customer work orders (demands). When managers apply the “right” tools, this stimulus and response situation can be virtually seamless. Management in Lean organizations has “two major functions: maintaining or controlling the existing processes, and improving existing processes” (Charron, Harrington, Voehl, & Wiggin, 2015, p. 1). Performance management occurs through continuous improvement, and emphasizes staff development, socio-technical (belief) systems, and change management. High performing companies are paying increasingly more attention to organizational culture that focuses on reliability and safety (Weick & Roberts, 1993). Organizational goal success can seem entirely random without effective management. On some days, the production might be Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Management and front line staff will not know when or why either will occur. This is akin to employees starting each day with the important question, “Do I feel lucky?” This mode of operation is very stressful and costly, and one never feels in control of their processes or environment because so much of the output is ruled by chance. LMS approaches have been successfully applied in hundreds of organizations and two prominent examples in health care are at Virginia Mason and Baylor, Scott & White (BS&W). A recent book, The Power of Ideas to Transform Healthcare: Engaging Staff by Building Daily Lean Management Systems by Steve Hoeft and Robert W. Pryor (2016), thoroughly documents the BS&W Lean journey. The authors credit the successful LMS implementation to the continuous implementation of staff-generated ideas. Lean management is the vehicle for this staff engagement and the continuous infusion of suggestions successfully implemented in both the clinics and administrative activities. The basic principles apply across the board in both health care services and manufacturing (Hoeft & Pryor, 2016). A more in-depth treatment can be found in Mann (2015) where he shows how it can become even more powerful when attention is devoted to organizational culture. The LMS model shown in FIGURE 5.3 is adapted from Mann (2015) and is represented as a Venn diagram because there are interconnections and overlaps between the three components. Everything begins with the Leader Standard Work, because that is where supervision through executive activities and the standardization of the processes of the other elements are spelled out. For example, how do leaders select and maintain the data in Visual Controls (see the following sections), how is their Daily Accountability (see the following sections) implemented, and how are staff held to account on a regular basis.

FIGURE 5.3 Lean Management System Model The three interconnected variables of leader standard work, visual controls, and daily accountability are influenced by the important factor of discipline. Discipline and stable leadership are needed to ensure that long term success and flow are maximized at the juncture where important parts of the model align. The Toyota Production System argues that organizational culture can change through the inculcation of principles delineated in the Four P Model (Liker & Ross, 2017, p. 48) and include: 1. Problem solving for continuous organizational learning and alignment to objectives and plans 2. People are respected, challenged, engaged and developed 3. Processes are improved and stabilized based on customer defined “value” 4. Philosophy of long-term focus Staff must be allowed to devote time to completely understand and reflect on their work activities in order to identify waste and Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A.

Ideally, at least 20 data points are needed for a significant “minimum” trend, but a minimum of seven data points should be used when tracking seasonal changes that are so crucial for health care planning (Balestracci, 2015). When more data is available, it is easier to differentiate between common- and special-cause variation. Lean management is a very hands-on activity requiring supervisors and line managers to actively apply these principles on the work floor or “gemba.” They cannot manage this from their offices while reviewing data or reports and answering emails.

This begins with Leader Standard Work. Leader Standard Work LMS does not assume that employees, including managers and leaders, know what they are supposed to do. Best practices or standards are clearly spelled out in detail and often posted in activity areas. Common examples include hand washing directions in rest rooms or graphical safety directions for using dangerous equipment. These best practices are updated as new standards and improvements are made. A lack of standardized work increases variation and can produce very strange data distributions. Variation is a key element in the VUT equation. Different types of patients or invoices require specialized “handling” and will require multiple methods and change-overs, etc. This tends to reduce cycle time. On the other hand, a generalized approach can restrict flow and slow down processes.

They observe, listen and question. Staff are encouraged and rewarded to speak up and find simple solutions (kaizens) to improve the value work stream. Staff are coached and developed in an apprentice model. Working with staff, managers assist in removing barriers, search for ways to improve flow capacity, and reduce process variation, capacity restraints, and cycle time. This direct contact between management and frontline workers builds trust, and provides opportunities for much learning, data collection, and problem identification before it is filtered by middle management.

Key management data are displayed on a wall that is convenient for staff to view during the daily huddles. Huddles will be addressed more completely in the Daily Accountability Section (later in the chapter). Staffing levels, equipment and inventory are checked because that also impacts capacity. Supervisors and managers should also briefly review the day’s work before going home and especially consider visiting the hospital on weekends where they can help focus on work that can prevent excessive harm on weekends (Shulkin, 2008). Directors and hospital administrators should also go to the gemba or “rounds” at least once a day in one of their many areas or locations (Saposnik, 2007). This helps managers understand the value streams and their regular presence motivates staff to stay focused and continuously improve (Bendavid et al., 2007). These activities are less frequent but no less important. Note the importance of regular champion meetings to address ongoing improvement needs. These weekly or biweekly staff meetings are longer, sit-down events that communicate important organizational changes, deal with near miss or process failures, etc. Discussions can also be more in-depth, but this is not time for microlevel problem solving.

Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. A process map or flowchart is a visual representation of the care process that is created with information provided by team members. The process mapping exercise can help clinicians clarify through visualization what they know about their environment and determine what they want to improve about it (Barach & Johnson, 2006). The process maps use common flowchart symbols and can describe the current state or baseline, the improved state in transition, and the optimal state. The exercise helps clinicians make assumptions and expectations explicit and can provide insights into reflections on their current state and, importantly, into how to improve the process of care or to overcome barriers they perceive to its improvement (Johnson et al., 2012). The numbered steps facilitate an honest discussion and the process efficiency times are a useful ratio for assessing what is value-added time versus nonvalue-added timed activities (Hollingsworth et al., 1998). An important part of a LMS is “learning to see” what is happening in the value stream or process. The visual display of the right data facilitates this awareness and is crucial because measurement influences behavior. In this approach, the “right” data focuses attention on variation, utilization/capacity, and time (VUT). Clinical microsystems should monitor and analyze no more than four to five key performance indicators (KPIs) because staff focus can easily be distracted and overwhelmed (Mohr, Bataden, Barach, 2004). Ideal health care metrics might include the cycle time, patient wait times, medical errors, scheduling errors, patient volumes, provider volumes, and takt times. Takt is the German word for the baton that an orchestra conductor uses to regulate the tempo of the music. In Lean, takt time is the rate at which a finished product needs to be completed in order to meet customer demand, and patient satisfaction, etc. (Rother, 2010). The data collection should include important variables such as types of patients, providers, and errors. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

You may also collect data for the important parts of the clinical process such as times for door-to-doctor; doctor-to-decision; and decision-todisposition. This enables stratification or the necessary “drilling down” into the datasets to find specific answers to the many important management questions. It is important that an appropriate sampling plan be developed, as described in Chapter 4 and throughout the CQI evolution, including the earliest work of Deming. There are various approaches that can be used to select primary data for CQI processes (Perla, Provost, & Murray, 2013). For many organizations, the management metrics used to understand and manage work processes are often based on averages rather than understanding actual variation in processes (Kim, Spahlinger, Kin, & Billi, 2006). For example, the length of stay (LOS) is often reported as an average length of stay (ALOS) and resource utilization is also reported in averages, etc. This would be adequate if the data did not fluctuate much around the average. As previously stated, patient demand tends to vary hour to hour, day to day, and seasonally, while patient conditions can also markedly differ. How do we better manage and ultimately improve our health care processes? Ideally, the data would be automatically collected by the electronic health record (EHR) or another database aligned throughout the organization. This produces a synergistic effect of added value. “Like magnetism, alignment is a force. It coalesces and focuses an organization and moves it forward” (Labowski & Rosansky, 1997, p. 6).

Unfortunately, this is not the current reality in most organizations, as process data (e.g., waiting time, variation in test and treatment order sets among physicians, real-time utilization of key resources, errors or near-miss causes, etc.) are often not tracked or readily available in the IT applications used in clinical processes. Instead, the data tracked in the IT systems are related to activity transactions per patient such as orders made and fulfilled, tests or procedures applied, and medications administered, etc. The huddle board design template (FIGURE 5.5) was successfully implemented at a large health care revenue cycle management organization. Some data examples will follow later. Each team constructed their own board and creative differences were encouraged. It was important to display the current process map for quick reference and context. Finally, each team posted a list of what their successful outcomes would contribute to the next downstream group in the value stream. For example, chart recovery staff had time and accuracy goals to expedite coding. This helped employees understand how they contributed to the “big picture.” Suneja and Suneja (2010) use the term “Glass Wall” for the same concept. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

FIGURE 5.6 Average ED Process Cycle Times for Sampled Patients on November 15, 2016 A quick glance at the trend reveals nonrandom patterns, including what some authors define as “astronomical” data points (i.e., the two unusually large values at 10:00 AM and 12:00 AM) (Perla, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. Created from westerngovernors-ebooks on 2023-04-25 02:13:31.

These warrant further analysis using other CQI tools; the analysis methodology and these CQI tools are presented below and described further in Chapter 4. This leads to the second row on the huddle board, where “drilldowns” or stratification charts can be displayed. These charts can be tacked under each high-level chart from the first row and can be presented in a chronological “pile” that can be easily explored. Appropriate charts include Pareto charts for medical errors/harm and controls charts for both trended errors and process times (Johnson & Barach, 2017). A typical control chart can be seen in FIGURE 5.7. FIGURE 5.7 XbarR Door-to-Doctor Times for Sampled Patients on November 15, 2016 Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

The XbarR charts in Figure 5.7 displays the means (Xbar) of each sub-group (solid lines). The dashed lines represent different standard deviation levels. In these control charts, four patients were tracked at the beginning of each hour in the initial door-todoctor phase of an ED redesign process. This is in-between group variation, and there are some obvious special cause outliers and other patterns (see Chapter 4 for further description of special cause variation). The accompanying range (R) chart in Figure 5.7 shows the corresponding within group variation. Box plots (FIGURE 5.8) are great graphical tools for comparing distributions of variable data such as time passed and costs of care. This graph looks at how much time ED physicians take from when then they first talk to their patients to the time when they make their clinical decisions. Box plots provide an interesting perspective on managing variation in care. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care.

FIGURE 5.8 Box Plot for Physicians to Assess Their Decision Times A quick glance at Figure 5.8 shows that the physicians labeled #12214, 11288, and 12215 are spending relatively more time with their patients than physicians labeled #139, 309, 378, 11215, 11082, 12214, and 13179. The physicians labeled #13159, 13259, and 13179 had a wider range of times to come to their decisions. This time data is important because it impacts both utilization (capacity) and process time.

All rights reserved. only compare patients who are admitted with respiratory distress related issues (e.g., flu, pneumonia) then it is expected that although there may be outliers in LOS, in general the middle 50% of the patients admitted for respiratory reasons by different physicians should be similar. Rather than looking at the exceptions as represented by outliers outside the boxes, compare the size of the boxes representing the amount of variation in the middle 50% of the LOS data. It is reasonable to expect similar results between physicians for the middle 50%. If the variation in the LOS for these physicians is quite different, then the natural question is what might be causing the variation in outcomes. The reasons may include physicians ordering more tests and treatments than their colleagues which may result in longer LOS for their patients. Some physicians may either use standard order sets or have a very welldefined process for handling respiratory challenged patients, hence they are more consistent in their LOS results. Rather than challenging staff to explain to others the reason for differences in variation, it is better to provide staff with the information in a graphical format and let them discuss it among themselves. Having variation data displayed with box plots is useful as it is easy to understand if applied on a regular basis and often sparks dialogue among providers to understand why variation is occurring. A Pareto chart (first introduced in Chapter 4) is a powerful tool to help graphically illustrate variation, as illustrated in FIGURE 5.9. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

FIGURE 5.9 Missing Chart Elements From a Coding QA Review It is obvious in Figure 5.9 that some providers need to sign their charts before the charts can be coded and billed. Missing signatures accounted for 71% of the sampled errors. A second level Pareto analysis can drill down to show which providers are the primary offenders. Knowing the “real” times to complete documentation or see patients provides essential information for improving the process. If “production” is one of the first row KPIs, then pitch charts (FIGURE 5.10) can be used to track work output during specific periods of time against goals. Examples of production might include numbers of tests completed in the lab, images read by radiologists, or charts coded during revenue cycle management (RCM). Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A.

Another application for traffic light colors could be for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Five Star Quality Rating System. The 4s and 5s would be green; yellow would be used for 3s, 2s, and 1s would be red. Lighter and darker color shading could also be used for the reds and greens. The third row of the huddle board is a great place to show capacity and other data such as a training matrix (FIGURE 5.11). This is a simple way to show the most “strategic” skills and which staff members have mastered them. Dates of attainment could be used instead of the Xs. FIGURE 5.11 Staff Skills and Cross-Training Matrix Another helpful capacity tool is an overlay run chart (FIGURE 5.12). An overlay run chart can be used to calculate the demand and capacity, both important aspects of the VUT equation. Managers must successfully juggle patient volume (demand) with staff availability. These two trend lines can easily show what capacity existed during that reporting time period given the varying patient demands. Was there adequate coverage later in the day?

Management actively engages with staff when they “go to the gemba” and during huddles (Ben-Tovim et al., 2007). This can also include regular follow-up discussions on clinical improvement projects. Gemba walks are at the core of Lean practice. Going to “where the work occurs” is the best place to collect real time data. This happens when supervisors and managers observe, listen, challenge and question each other.

FIGURE 5.16 Huddle Board Example 2 Coaching is another important piece of daily accountability because it is the preferred way to development staff and improve accountability (Sherrard, Trypuc, & Hudson, 2009). Managers must respect their workers to be effective coaches. This is accomplished by asking staff how something should be done as opposed to just telling them the correct way to complete a task. Coaches model appropriate behaviors and use shaping and modeling to help staff perfect new skills. Shaping involves reinforcing each successive approximation until mastery is achieved. Incorrect behaviors are corrected but that can be initiated by asking the worker if the task was completed correctly. If they acknowledge the error, then the follow-up question can be “How would you improve it?” Continuing to engage staff and attentively listening to the staff suggestions are the most important output of daily accountability meetings. This “sense-making” is a huge part of engendering trust, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care.

Observing and questioning also facilitates critical thinking.

Conclusions Lean Management Systems (LMS) and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) offer an approach, a set of tools, and a way of thinking about how to more effectively assess and study clinical flow, including addressing variation in process and operations. These methodologies are widely applicable in studying and improving quality and efficiency of health processes spanning health care, public health and other settings. A particular LSS example illustrated in this chapter is an application to the Patient Flow Physics Framework. It illustrates that improvement requires an understanding of the patient care process flows (e.g., process maps or flow charts), the factors that drive variation in the process, resource utilization impacts on the process, and the relationships of patient care flow cycle times are impacted by poor or inefficient process design. Improving clinical teamwork is an important factor in improving patient outcomes. In fact, it is a requirement for effective use of the tools described in this chapter. Indeed, quality improvement efforts are not about which tools are used but about how these tools can produce insight, engage the team members, and track patient progress. Their purpose is to help people function as a team, as well as to improve patient outcomes. The importance of teamwork in LMS and LSS as well as other CQI initiatives and methods will be discussed further in Chapter 6. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Edwards Deming Teams play a major part in all aspects of health care. In quality improvement, the team is the primary vehicle through which problems are analyzed, solutions are generated, and changes evaluated. Effective teamwork is a key factor influencing the diffusion and successful implementation of quality improvement (QI) in health care. In this chapter, brief case studies are used to illustrate the potential of teams for fostering improvement in organizations and the problems encountered when teams are poorly organized. CASE STUDY 6.1 illustrates both the positive and negative potential of teams. State University Hospital (SUH) sought to assemble an integrated, multidepartmental team to address a complex problem involving many organizational components that rarely interacted in a concerted, coordinated manner. Each department had developed systems addressing end-of-life records and documentation for its own processes. However, because these were not integrated with other departments’ systems, all departments experienced problems that were badly compounded by an unpredicted environmental change brought to light by State Donor Services (SDS). In its initial attempt to address the organ donation problem, the team was given inadequate time to get organized, leading to a production schedule that was unrealistic. The tight time frame did not provide adequate time to determine the composition of the team. Several members lacked 175 CASE STUDY 6.1: STATE UNIVERSIT Y HOSPITAL AND STATE DONOR SERVICES State Donor Services (SDS) centrally manages the state’s organ procurement and donation process. There had been a trend of declining organ availability for transplant, despite efforts to increase awareness and success in registering donors through the Division of Motor Vehicles. To help solve the problem, SDS approached State University Hospital (SUH), one of the biggest sources of and utilizers of donated organs through its renowned organ transplant programs. Initial exploration of the problem quickly indicated a consistent demand for organs, but organ donations at SUH were down, matching the pattern seen by SDS. Chris Carter, the new administrator for SUH’s emergency department, was asked to build a team to solve this problem for SUH. The hospital’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) told Chris that this was a top priority because of the high visibility of the transplant programs, the revenues it brought to the institution, and the fact that the Chairman of Surgery had just threatened to leave","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement_0"}}],["768",{"pageContent":". The hospital’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) told Chris that this was a top priority because of the high visibility of the transplant programs, the revenues it brought to the institution, and the fact that the Chairman of Surgery had just threatened to leave the institution if SUH “didn’t fix this problem it had obviously created.” The COO gave Chris 2 weeks to get a team together and develop a solution, which Chris would present at SUH’s monthly Executive Committee meeting. Chris asked the COO for advice regarding whom to have on the team, and the COO referred him to the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO). Chris went immediately to the CNO, but the first available meeting time she had was in 3 days. In the meantime, Chris gathered as much information as possible. On the third day, the CNO’s secretary called to cancel the meeting but suggested that he talk with the Nursing Division Director for Medicine. She met with Chris that afternoon, and together, they formulated a list of people they thought would be able to address the issue. SUH was a functionally structured organization, so they built a team with nursing directors from each of the transplant services and the emergency department, the Director of Patient Care Services, a clerk, a physician from the emergency room, and the State Medical Examiner—whose office was located at SUH and who was responsible for autopsies—as well as a clerk from his office. The earliest possible meeting time for this group was in 3 weeks— well beyond the COO’s deadline. Nonetheless, Chris set up a meeting with as many team members as possible and met with the others individually. The team would be able to meet only once or perhaps twice given the aggressive deadline and members’ schedules. Fearing the approaching deadline and wanting to waste no time, Chris got right to business when the group met. He told the group his goals and invited an open discussion of each team member’s experiences with organ procurement. It quickly became evident that several members of the team were too new or too junior to be helpful, with some of Chris’s invitees having asked more junior colleagues to be a part of the team in their stead. The Medical Examiner immediately called into question the validity of the group and the authority by which he had been called to this meeting. When Chris told him this was a high-priority project for the COO and CNO—stating only their names and not their titles—the Medical Examiner indignantly replied that","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement_1"}}],["769",{"pageContent":"the group and the authority by which he had been called to this meeting. When Chris told him this was a high-priority project for the COO and CNO—stating only their names and not their titles—the Medical Examiner indignantly replied that he had never heard of these people and that this was a waste of his time. When Chris clarified their titles, the Medical Examiner became less vocal, but remained indignant. He had been focused on solving a problem of declining autopsies, which placed SUH at risk of violating a state regulation. He was angry to have been diverted from this pressing problem and felt that Chris’s group would draw organizational focus and energies away from his own needs. His resentment spread to others in the group, which, coupled with their inexperience and a lack of appropriate representation, rendered the meeting—and the group—effectively useless. In an effort to avoid a public display of this disaster, Chris reported his lack of success to the COO prior to the Executive Committee meeting. The COO realized the impossibility of the goals he had set for Chris. He extended the deadline 3 months and also utilized his own authority by agreeing to 176 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement experience, and while they were supportive of the team’s goals, they could not contribute in a significant way to the team’s work. Senior management provided inadequate support to the team, neglecting to extend the authority of organization leaders to the team and its chair. This led some key team members to dismiss the team as inconsequential and to an overall lack of commitment. The events at SUH illustrate multiple violations of building a successful, high- performing team. The situation was improved, however, as senior management became more involved, setting an appropriate timeline, changing membership, and conveying the importance of the team to the organization. As team composition and size were restructured to include the appropriate participants, senior management also granted the team visible and legitimate authority to undertake its tasks, and an environment of psychological safety was created where open communication was encouraged and individual team members could contribute with no risk of rebuke by others. Teams are pervasive in health care and used for virtually every activity carried out in health care organizations, including clinical and management-focused activities.

While our knowledge of evidence-based practices continues to grow, implementation of these practices has been uneven and fragmented. The recent development of the field of implementation science, introduced in Chapter 3, has sought to address the challenges of putting evidence into practice (Nilsen, 2015). While there is an array of obstacles to implementation, the application of medical knowledge to clinical service delivery is limited by the effectiveness and efficiency of teams charged with putting that knowledge into practice. Similarly, as new management techniques and technologies are developed, including QI methods, successful use of these approaches is dependent upon appropriately staffed, well-functioning teams. Clearly, we have moved well beyond the era of the autonomous heroic clinician (or manager, for that matter). It is not a stretch to state that behind every successful clinician or manager is a high-functioning team (or teams). And given what we know about the effectiveness of teams in most organizations, it can safely be said that the performance of virtually all clinicians and managers could be markedly improved by improvements in team effectiveness. Teams also play a critical role in improving the performance of health care systems, whether a medical group practice, a hospital inpatient unit, a long-term care facility, or local public health departments. While effective patient care certainly requires that physicians and others possess current clinical knowledge, patient outcomes often depend upon how well patient-care teams work— whether team members understand and agree on patient-care goals, how members communicate with each other, and the effectiveness of team leadership. In sum, teams are the building blocks of health care organizations and are absolutely essential to implementing plans, caring for populations and individual patients, and identifying and successfully attend the next team meeting. These two key factors allowed Chris to rebuild a more knowledgeable, representative, and experienced team. Ultimately, the organ donation problem was traced to a series of new federal regulations and SUH’s fragmented approach to processing end-of-life paperwork. In summary, each operational unit had established its own processes for responding to the regulatory requirements, none of which were integrated with the other operational units, thus creating hours of work for the clinical staff, most of whom gave up trying to secure organ donations. Interestingly, the Medical Examiner’s problem of a declining autopsy rate was also a result of this same disjointed method of paperwork processing.

Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement 177 solving quality problems. Teams are not an option but a necessity. As such, it makes great sense to examine these building blocks and see how they can be strengthened. In this chapter, the concept of team is applied very broadly, and shares characteristics with the concept of microsystems (Nelson et al., 2002), which are also discussed in greater detail, with specific application to patient safety, in Chapter 9. A microsystem is one of several subsystems of a larger system that is integral to system performance. This perspective, drawn from systems theory, is not a new concept but clearly helps us understand how the human body, an automobile, or an organization, operates. When examining the performance of any system, it is essential to examine (among other factors) the effectiveness of each component subsystem (e.g., the respiratory system), how these subsystems work together (e.g., the nature and adequacy of coordination between a hospital pharmacy and an inpatient unit), and the adequacy of information about system and subsystem performance (e.g., the extent to which the driver of an automobile is provided with information about the automobile’s performance). According to this view, a health system is composed of many subsystems. In patient care, these may be referred to as clinical microsystems or frontline systems, referring to teams charged with meeting the needs of the patient population. It is these smaller microsystems that actually provide those services that result in positive patient outcomes, provider and patient safety, system efficiency, and patient satisfaction. And as is true with any large system, the effectiveness of any large health care system can be no better than the microsystems of which it is composed ( Nelson et al., 2002). Using the terminology of the microsystem, it is apparent how a microsystem is in fact one type of team, as defined by Nelson et al. (2002): A clinical microsystem is a small group of people who work together on a regular basis to provide care to discrete subpopulations of patients. It has clinical and business aims, linked processes, and a shared information environment, and it produces performance outcomes. Microsystems evolve over time and are often embedded in larger organizations.

Microsystems evolve over time and are often embedded in larger organizations. They are complex adaptive systems, and as such they must do the primary work associated with core aims, meet the needs of internal staff, and maintain themselves over time as clinical units. (p. 474) This definition may be slightly altered to apply to all other types of teams in health care. The key concepts in relation to teams are as follows: ■ People work together toward specific goals. ■ They use multiple interconnected processes. ■ They produce performance outcomes. ■ They have access to information about the team’s performance. In addition, teams must adapt to changing circumstances, ensure the satisfaction of team members, and maintain and improve their performance over time. In this chapter, we bring together several traditions of research on teams. We demonstrate how our knowledge of teams informs our understanding of team performance and the important role of teams in QI efforts. Most of the research on team effectiveness has been carried out in relatively permanent teams with stable membership and opportunities for face-to-face interactions. However, many teams in health care and other sectors exist for only a short period of time, perhaps as short as a nursing shift. Because QI teams typically draw from multiple parts of an organization, these teams may exist for a limited period of time. These types of teams must organize themselves rapidly, and may not have the luxury of going through extended stages of team development. In this chapter, attention is given 178 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement to traditional as well as temporary teams. Simply put, today’s teams do not always fit into traditional team structures and processes, and we need to account for these variations when discussing health care teams. ▸ Teams in Health Care As medical knowledge grows increasingly complex and medical specialties continue to develop around specific focus areas of that knowledge, there is a risk that health care organizations will lose their patient-centered orientation. There is a paradox in relation to the adoption of new medical technologies and procedures. On the one hand, increasingly specific diagnostic and treatment procedures imply a narrowing of focus. This is desirable because we all support the discovery and implementation of procedures to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnoses and the development of pharmaceuticals, technology, and procedures that treat a disease in a manner that is most specific to the individual and the disease state. However, to diagnose, treat, and provide continuing care to a patient requires information from multiple sources and,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement_5"}}],["773",{"pageContent":"the development of pharmaceuticals, technology, and procedures that treat a disease in a manner that is most specific to the individual and the disease state. However, to diagnose, treat, and provide continuing care to a patient requires information from multiple sources and, very often, the involvement of multiple individuals. For example, psycho pharmacology has become increasingly specific and sophisticated. However, better utilization of new pharmaceuticals for the benefit of the patient requires that psychiatrists have an understanding of a patient’s social environment, which may require the knowledge base of social workers and others. That is, a team of individuals (e.g., social worker, psychiatric nurse) is likely required to ensure that patients are compliant and that home support and respite services are available to caregivers. Thus, the need for patient-centered multispecialty teams becomes ever more important as health care providers and organizations specialize and strive to deliver the best and most appropriate care possible. Health care system complexity extends beyond the clinical care arena and into administrative areas. Teams fill an organizational need of helping to identify and respond to changes brought about by legal and regulatory changes, more complex payer contracts, and increasing accountability and pressure for value. At the most basic level, clinical health care teams are comprised of health care providers including nonclinical personnel from multiple disciplines, focusing on a patient or patient population with similar health care needs. This patient-centeredness has extended upward and outward to all aspects of many health care organizations. Indeed, the industry has seen a trend away from organizational structures based on functional areas of technical expertise (e.g., nursing, environmental services, registration, medicine, surgery) and toward functionally integrated organizational structures with clinical care teams based on patient needs (e.g., children’s services, women’s services, cancer care services). Individual clinical specialists serving on these teams report not only to their disciplinary head (e.g., chief of nursing, chair of medicine), but also to team leaders associated with specific patientcentered service areas. This “dual reporting” format is described in organizational management literature as a matrix structure (Grove, 1995; Burns, Bradley, & Weiner, 2011). As discussed later in this chapter, dual reporting requirements pose challenges for managing multidisciplinary teams. While the multidisciplinary team model has been adopted to improve patient-centered health, these teams and supporting organizational structures do not spontaneously form, nor are they easily managed. In fact, reward systems often work against the formation and effectiveness of teams.

In fact, reward systems often work against the formation and effectiveness of teams. Reward systems are typically designed around performance of one’s particular discipline or function, rather than on an individual’s role on teams. Where teams do exist, performance is, more often than not, suboptimal. A substantial body of research demonstrates that Teams in Health Care 179 key elements are necessary for teams to perform to their maximum potential (Hackman, 2002). If these elements are not attended to, dysfunctional teams can result in team member and patient dissatisfaction, disjointed care provision, and inefficient and ineffective operations nested in a cumbersome bureaucracy. ▸ High-Performance Teams and Quality Improvement The focus of this chapter is on the critical role of high-performing teams in QI efforts, and on strategies to improve team effectiveness. The value of teams was established in the earliest applications of QI as a way to ensure the multidisciplinary sharing of knowledge (Deming, 1986). In modern health care, teams are critical to success in QI for a number of reasons. 1. Quality problems are often not visible to managers at middle or senior management levels, but the impact of problems can be experienced by the entire organization, as shown in the organ donation case (Case Study 6-1). Hospital staff nurses, for example, may see repeated examples of poor communications between shifts that result in a myriad of problems for patients and families, physicians, and other hospital staff. Each occurrence of a problem may be dealt with and resolved in a satisfactory manner; however, in aggregate, these communication problems may become costly in terms of wasted time, reduced quality and patient safety, and lack of continuity of care. Individuals on the front lines are quite frequently aware of systemic problems requiring methodical analysis. One can easily make the case that the farther one is from the front lines of care, the more removed one is from seeing and solving day-today problems. Thus, if we wish to identify quality problems and optimal solutions, we need individuals on our teams who are close to the problem and can help uncover root causes. 2. Health care organizations accomplish their work through a myriad of processes, which may be flawed, confusing, or inefficient.

Health care organizations accomplish their work through a myriad of processes, which may be flawed, confusing, or inefficient. In some instances, a process itself may be ineffective, while in other cases, a well-designed process may be poorly implemented. That is, what appears theoretically on paper as an effective process flowchart may be entirely inaccurate when compared to how the process actually operates. Regardless, much of QI involves process analysis and improvement. Individuals working in dysfunctional processes are often most knowledgeable about process impacts and causes. Therefore, to understand a process, it is essential to have participation from individuals who have the most accurate and detailed understanding of the process. 3. Individuals at the front lines often have unique knowledge and insight into organizational problems and are thus in a position to offer effective and feasible suggestions for improvement. It has long been known that individuals at relatively low levels of the organization often acquire considerable knowledge about the organization and are positioned to reduce uncertainty in the organization, and, in some cases, may use this knowledge to acquire 180 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement power (Crozier, 1964). For example, a receptionist who has worked in a pediatric group practice over several years may have a very clear understanding of why waiting times are unacceptably long at certain times of the day. As a result of that experience, he or she may have a well-reasoned understanding of how the practice operates and may have valuable suggestions about how scheduling and staffing may be altered to help ameliorate the waiting time problem. Note as well that because the receptionist is a “ nonprofessional,” this person may never have been asked to provide input. If we are interested in solving such a problem, it is important to have individuals on a team who understand the problem and can suggest changes that are both effective and feasible. 4. Addressing quality problems requires the support of all affected individuals, not simply those at middle or senior management levels. Identifying and proposing solutions to quality problems is central to QI efforts, but unless those involved in solution implementation understand fully the rationale for the effort, implementation is likely to fall short. Those involved in implementing the solution must be involved so that they understand the QI strategy and can identify possible obstacles to effective implementation. 5.

High-functioning teams empower people by providing opportunities for meaningful participation in problem identification and problem solving. Participants feel they are contributing in a positive way to the larger success of the organization, and not simply through their particular discipline. Among the consequences of empowerment is that people feel greater commitment to the organization and have a stronger sense of ownership. Empowerment also has a direct impact on increasing team members’ motivation, a critical element in successful QI initiatives (Daft, 2015). Together, these consequences promote in people a greater willingness to participate in developing and implementing solutions. As seen in the introductory organ donation example, the well-intentioned manager tasked with solving an institution-wide problem was unable to constitute a team with appropriate members. As a result, the team was frustrated in its inability to achieve its goals. However, one cannot place the blame entirely on the manager. An unrealistic timeline and the absence of initial support by senior management both played a role in the team’s failure. Given a second chance, and provided with a more appropriate timeline and sufficient authority, the manager built a team comprised of individuals with appropriate experience and organizational diversity; this team was able to develop, perform, and reach its goals. Such well-designed and managed teams can maximize communication, collaboration, patient and staff satisfaction, and effective and efficient clinical care provision in an organization that is continually able to adapt and improve in the changing environment. How do we develop and sustain highperforming QI teams? There is much that we know about successful teams, and while there is no guarantee that using all of the concepts and recommendations in this chapter will bring success, the chapter provides a framework to increase the likelihood of team success and avoid many of the pitfalls faced by teams. Understanding key aspects of team dynamics can help to guide improvement efforts.

Understanding the fundamental purposes of a team guides other aspects of team development and management, including team composition, decision- making processes, and the types of interdependencies the team has with other entities in the organization. In general, we can state that QI teams are, by definition, focused on identifying and analyzing quality and patient safety problems, designing interventions to address these problems, and evaluating the impact of changes. In one form or another, teams complete tasks aligned with the Planning, Doing, Checking, Acting (PDCA) cycle, which was first introduced in Chapter 1 and is discussed with various applications throughout this text. The clarity of the task as well as the authority/empowerment of the team to carry out improvement efforts is very important in engaging team members. Essentially, team members should have a shared understanding of the goals of the team. Although some teams have clear and self-evident goals, QI teams may face ambiguity. The nature of QI itself is a process of discovery; as root causes of problems are uncovered, teams may find that the task of the team changes. For example, a team working in a clinic in a low-income country may be investigating the problem of drug stock-outs. The team may find that a key root cause of the problem is an inconsistent supply chain, and supply chain problems in turn are due to poor communication between clinic staff and a central supply depot. Further, communication problems may be due to frequent gaps in electricity in the clinic as well as in the supply depot. An intervention to reduce stock-outs may therefore require team members with expertise in addressing problems of power outages and connectivity. In this case, the initial composition of the team may be inadequate to address the root cause of the problem. The team may wish to add a team member from the supply depot to help suggest changes in how and when the clinic communicates with the supply depot. The point here is that as fundamental underlying problems are identified, a team’s tasks may change. In the preceding example, a new task emerged: addressing power outages. A common problem in teams is related to a lack of clarity about the team’s authority to implement change. The question arises as to whether a team has the authority to make decisions and implement changes, or simply to make recommendations. There is no single answer to this question; many highly variable factors ranging from organizational politics to intra-organizational dynamics to environmental changes may influence a team’s authority.

As illustrated in the Greenwood Family Medicine example (CASE STUDY 6.2), goal definition presents a problem. The initial goal in the case study’s situation was to improve the provision of preventive services. However, little analytic effort was spent trying to understand the important causes of the problem. The team adopted a premature solution, and the goal 182 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement CASE STUDY 6.2: PREVENTIVE SERVICES AT GREENWOOD FAMILY MEDICINE Greenwood Family Medicine is a five-clinician family medicine practice serving a largely middleclass suburban population. In addition to the medical staff, the practice employs four nurses, one receptionist, and three medical records and insurance technicians. The practice recently identified two priority areas: attention to family concerns and greater emphasis on ensuring the provision of timely preventive services. The latter effort was prompted by one of the physicians, who had recently attended a continuing medical education program on preventive services. Upon her return, she decided to assess the practice’s provision of preventive services. With a nurse and one of the medical records technicians, she reviewed a sample of children’s patient charts. She and the other physicians were surprised when she distributed the results: ■ Half of the children were behind schedule in at least one immunization. ■ No patient charts noted that children had had vision screening. ■ Fifty percent of children had not had anemia screening. ■ Seventy-five percent of children had not had their blood pressure recorded in the chart. ■ Eighty-five percent had not had tuberculosis screening. ■ Eighty-seven percent of children had not been screened for lead exposure. The medical staff was surprised by these findings, but medical records personnel and nursing staff found this information consistent with their impressions.

The review indicated that even children who were seen for an annual physical were often not updated on preventive services—or if they were, this information was not recorded in the patient chart. It was felt that high patient volume made it impossible to ensure that appropriate preventive services were provided to all children. In addition, the practice saw many drop-in patients. The nurses felt that while these drop-ins caused added tension from the increased workload, they also presented an opportunity to check on patients’ needs for preventive services. The findings were discussed at the monthly meeting for all staff, and it was decided to form a team to address the problem. A medical records technician was asked to schedule a meeting. It was decided that two nurses and four physicians would participate on this team. The first meeting was scheduled over the noon hour (12:00 PM to 1:00 PM). One physician arrived at 12:20, while another had to leave early, at 12:45. Virtually the entire meeting was spent attempting to find an appropriate date and time for follow-up meetings. At the next meeting, the physicians stated that during an acute visit, physicians simply do not have time to go through the chart to determine if a patient needs updating on preventive services. It was decided, therefore, that the nurses would review each chart for the day’s patients and fasten a form listing all preventive services. Services needing updating would be circled. The medical records staff was asked to design this form. When the physicians saw the resulting form, they felt it was poorly designed. Some services were not included, and immunization schedule information was not included. The physicians asked the medical records technician to redesign the form. The technician and a nurse added the immunization schedule and other information. When presented to the physicians, they discovered disagreements in several areas. Immunization schedules differed, and practices varied on lead and TB screening. They decided that the form should include separate columns for each physician, each column specifying a physician’s preventive services preferences. A form was created reflecting each physician’s preventive service preferences.

While such a chart may have been useful as part of the solution to the performance gap in preventive services, the team became fixated on this as the solution, at the expense of generating other more impactful alternatives. Implementing a solution became the goal, and the team lost its initial focus on the problem of low preventive services rates. Team member time was spent constructing a tool instead of trying to understand the fundamental causes of the problem. Basically, a “solution” presented itself, and the solution became the goal in itself. A key problem faced as a result of this is that the team did not work on what seemed to be a very major problem facing the practice, namely, the variation in protocols for preventive services.

Team Characteristics Team characteristics refer to basic physical and social psychological aspects of a team and include team composition and size, relationships between team members, status differences, level of psychological safety, team norms, and the team’s stage of team development. All of these characteristics potentially affect the team effectiveness. Team Composition and Size What is the optimal composition and size of a team? This answer obviously depends upon the nature of the team, its goals, and tasks. In The Case Studies are reprinted with permission from a chapter by these authors in S. M. Shortell and A. D. Kaluzny, Health Care Management: Organization Design and Behavior, 5th ed. Albany, NY: Thomson Delmar Learning, 2006. 184 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement some cases, team size and composition are mandated, such as sports teams and accreditation teams. Teams must be sufficiently large to have the requisite expertise to get the work done, but not so large that they are cumbersome and difficult to manage. In the Greenwood Family Medicine example (Case Study 6-2), the team faced multiple problems because of its unwieldy size and difficulty scheduling meetings, keeping order during meetings, establishing a protocol for discussion, and decision making. Interestingly, although the team was too large, it did not in fact contain all of the expertise required to address the preventive services problem. The Institute for Health Improvement suggest that successful QI teams require four general types of expertise. A clinical leader is an individual who has authority in the organization to test and implement changes and to overcome implementation problems. A team member with technical expertise has a thorough understanding of the systems and processes of care. A third key area of expertise is a team member who is a subject matter expert and is in a position to drive the project on a day-to-day basis—a project manager of sorts. Finally, teams need a project sponsor who has the executive authority to serve as a link with senior management; this individual may or may not be a member of the team on a day-to-day basis (IHI, 2017), but is essential for success.

In the Greenwood Family Medicine example, the medical records staff, who foresaw the difficulties with the new system, were not included on the team—even to selectively provide input or react to proposed solutions. When deciding upon team composition, one needs to consider the tasks facing the team. For example, if information is required about information technology, it would naturally be helpful to have someone knowledgeable in this area. In the Greenwood Family Medicine case, abstracting information from medical records was a key aspect of the intervention. Medical records staff familiar with the structure of the medical record could have contributed substantially to the design of this intervention. Team size therefore goes hand-in-hand with team composition. The team must have adequate diversity and expertise to inform all aspects of the team’s tasks and goals. Yet the team must not be so large that reaching consensus or following an appropriate timeline is impossible. In Greenwood Family Medicine, it would have been advisable to cut the team size by 50% and ask team members to consult and obtain input from their constituencies about the team’s work. In today’s work world, team size and composition may vary significantly over short periods of time. An individual may join a team for a short period of time to address a specific technical problem. In addition, it is common for members in team meetings to rotate attendance. For example, if the nursing perspective is required to address a problem, it would not be uncommon for different nurses to attend team meetings over time. This type of arrangement is often necessary because of the realities of organizational life; people have multiple commitments and time pressures that may require flexibility in team membership. Furthermore, teams also vary in terms of their permanence and longevity. We traditionally think of teams as relatively permanent and stable groups of people. However, there are instances where a team must quickly form and work together over a short period of time. In health care organizations, teams may form and disband over a period of a shift. Edmondson (2012) coined the term “teaming” to refer to an organization capable of collaborating and coordinating without the necessary team structures, such as stable team membership. She refers to this capability as “team on the fly.” As described by Edmondson, individuals working in hospital emergency departments must work as a team, although each shift may bring different team members who may not have previously worked together.

Team Relationships and Status Because we often learn about quality problems from individuals situated at different levels and units of an organization, a central tenet of QI is participation of a broad array of team members. These include individuals at relatively low levels in the organization without formal authority but with considerable tacit knowledge. In fact, it is often those on the front lines who bring unique perspectives and insights into a situation. Involving an appropriate range of people is only the first step, however. In any team, people bring with them their roles and status from regular organizational life. Physicians working on a team with nurses bring with them their higher professional status and authority. The physician–nurse relationship, however that is characterized in a particular organization, is thus “imported” into the team. These preformed relationships and status systems may influence the participation of team members and affect the effectiveness of a team. Individuals from a lower status group are less likely to contribute than those of higher status. They may feel condescended to or intimidated, or they may simply feel that their input is not valued. For QI teams, such status differences are dysfunctional. To engage all team members and ensure that the team can utilize each member’s knowledge, QI team leaders need to find a way to diminish the impact of status differences. The important role of nurses as equals on QI teams should not be underestimated. For example, this recognition has contributed to the important leadership role of nurses in the development and implementation of a number of quality initiatives, such as surgical safety checklists (Gawande, 2009). Team members bring to the team previously formed relationships. We may find two individuals with a history of interpersonal problems serving on the same team. Unfortunately, relationship problems and dysfunctional status differences can dramatically affect the work of a team.

It is truly the remarkable team that can dispose of status differences and interpersonal animosities in the interest of team goals. At the very least, team leaders need to be aware of status differences and the impact of those differences on communication and team effectiveness. One way to avoid the problems of status difference and interpersonal conflict is to have a team leader with sufficient authority and respect act as moderator, encouraging lower status members to participate, keeping higher status members in check, and defusing tension driven by team member conflict. A key characteristic of effective team leaders that is often absent in science and health care activities is the ability to resolve conflicts (Sapienza, 2004); this is a characteristic which can increase motivation and help to ensure a team’s success. People who work on QI teams typically have “regular” jobs in the organization, and their participation in improvement efforts requires time away from their normal work. It is therefore important to reduce the amount of time lost to process issues, or issues that are not part of the actual task of the team. These include dealing with logistical issues such as scheduling meetings, as well as managing conflict. Teams may come together amidst great enthusiasm about tackling a difficult problem. However, the work of a group may create frictions and bring to the surface latent conflicts or reignite old disputes. Interprofessional rivalries, which may have been part of the organizational culture for many years, may surface, and leaders should devise strategies to manage and minimize these conflicts. Otherwise, a substantial amount of work time may be lost managing these conflicts. QI teams, like other teams, are also prone to personality clashes that may be very destructive to the work of a team. Health care is particularly prone to difficulties posed by 186 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement status differences because of the traditional professional hierarchy common in most organizations. In Greenwood Family Medicine, status differences were destructive to the work of the group. First, medical records staff were not included, likely because they were considered nonprofessional staff and their perspectives and opinions were discounted. Status differences, with likely elements of intimidation, also prevented both nurses and medical records staff from voicing their reservations about the use of the preventive services chart. There was also tension and status differences between the two “high-volume” physicians and others in the practice. These differences were not beneficial to the work of the team.

These differences were not beneficial to the work of the team. Psychological Safety Team psychological safety is defined as a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking (Edmondson, 1999). A central tenet of QI is the belief that people must be forthcoming and honest about quality problems, even where they themselves were responsible for, or shared responsibility for, a quality or patient safety incident. Individuals involved in improvement efforts must feel that their suggestions will be heard without fear of intimidation, condescension, or castigation (Deming, 1986). Where people feel safe, there is a greater likelihood of their participating effectively in QI efforts. Furthermore, psychological safety is an important prerequisite for implementing organizational change. People need to feel psychologically safe if they are to feel secure and capable of changing (Schein & Bennis, 1965). Status differences certainly affect psychological safety. Where status differences have an oppressive presence, it is very unlikely that team participants will feel the willingness to participate in discussions of quality. In the Greenwood Family Medicine case, the medical records staff had a clear sense that the preventive services chart plan was doomed to failure, but felt uninvited. Although they voiced reservations about the plan privately, they did not feel comfortable voicing their concerns. They had a fear, likely justifiable, that they would have been criticized by others in the practice for being negative, resistant to change, or perhaps lazy. This is similar to the Donor Services case (Case Study 6-1), where many of the lower-status team members were reluctant to participate actively or positively given the negative and highly vocal nature of the Medical Examiner, a higher-status individual with whom many of the team members had to work on a daily basis. They felt that if they didn’t follow his lead in the team meetings, they would incur repercussions later. Team leaders need to consider questions of psychological safety: Do participants feel safe in making recommendations, participating in discussions, and perhaps of greatest importance, expressing skepticism and disagreement? Leaders must examine their own behavior and assess the extent to which their leadership style and manner of interaction invites participation and promotes safety.

Team Norms A norm is a standard of behavior that is shared by team members. Norms set expectations and establish standards of behavior and performance. Norms have a strong impact on individuals in organizations, essentially establishing the “rules” under which people function. Behavioral norms consist of rules that govern individual behavior and attitudes. In a team context, behavioral norms define how people are expected to behave on a team. These may include expectations about attendance, preparation for team meetings, and the Understanding and Improving the Performance of Quality Improvement Teams 187 manner in which members communicate with each other during and between team meetings. Norms are different in every team. In the Greenwood Family Medicine case study, we see the interaction between status differences and norms. Although there was likely a superficial belief in the desirability of a democratic and participative climate, it was clear that behavioral norms emphasized a high regard for hierarchy. For example, nurses were directed to produce a form (and then several versions), and physicians declared the termination of the QI initiative. Norms about attendance at meetings were very loose—at least for the medical staff. One meeting, in which arguments ensued about whether the preventive services issue was office wide or specific to the physicians, ended with no conclusion, summary, or future plans. Evidently, norms were never established for how meetings would be conducted or expectations for attendance. Norms were nonexistent or dysfunctional. Participation was inhibited, full discussion of issues was repressed, and meetings were inefficient and ineffective. In contrast to behavioral norms, performance norms govern the amount and quality of work expected of team members. In the Greenwood Family Medicine case, performance norms were broken, leading to difficulties for the practice. While there were expectations about working hours for nurses, the new preventive services chart system required that they work up to 3 hours after regular working hours—a break from normal working hours. This change in work demand was not anticipated, and breaking this performance norm caused morale problems and the departure of at least one nurse.

Stages of Team Development Teams go through various life cycle stages, and different tasks and levels of productivity characterize each stage. We can conveniently think of teams going through four stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing. These stages, first described by Tuckman (1965), are best viewed as guides, and not rigid expectations. The speed with which teams proceed through these stages varies greatly and some teams never move to the final stage of performing. A team begins in the forming stage when goals and tasks are established. It is characterized by generally polite behavior among team members, which may mask underlying conflicts. Individuals often do not feel psychologically safe at this time and may be reluctant to contribute and unlikely to disagree. Team members, still unclear about the norms of the team, may stand back until they get a sense of norms and “rules” of the team. When team members begin to feel more comfortable, there may be a period of “ storming,” which may be mild or severe. Team members may compete for roles, may argue about team goals and processes, or may simply attempt to stake their ground. This type of conflict is normal, and if managed well by the team leader, can result in a resolution of important issues. If the team resolves its storming stage (which does not always happen), a norming stage emerges in which there is agreement on team norms and expectations. Team member roles are clarified, although these may change during the life of a team. Following the norming stage is a performing stage in which the team is in the best position to accomplish its goals. Conflicts have mainly been resolved, roles are clear, norms are established, and team time can be spent on the substantive work of the team rather than on process issues. Teams can function at all stages of their development. However, at earlier stages, much energy is lost to “process loss”—that is, focusing the team’s energies and time on team maintenance functions rather than on the substantive work of the team. Teams are most effective when they have matured, meaning they have successfully progressed through the first three stages and are able to focus on team goals and tasks. 188 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement What stage of development did the Greenwood Family Medicine team reach?

Norms of behavior were unclear (for example, attendance at meetings), decision making and rules for discussion were not well developed, and perhaps most importantly, role relationships among participants still reflected their roles in the practice. Physicians assumed a rather superior role in the practice, which may or may not have been appropriate. On the improvement team, however, such a role was clearly inappropriate and blocked the team from accessing information needed to address the preventive services problem. It is likely that the events that transpired in this case could have been predicted from observing the team’s inability to move through stages of development. ▸ Resources and Support As open systems, teams require resources in order to survive and flourish. Resources come in a number of forms, including financial resources; intellectual resources; information; people with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities; equipment; communication systems; and moral support and credibility. Furthermore, individual team members require support, including recognition for their work on the team and rewards for their performance. At the most fundamental level, a team functions best when ensconced within an organization that supports the concept of teamwork and, more specifically, respects the work done by the team. We begin our discussion of resources and support at this level, with a brief review of the definition and concepts related to organizational culture. Organizational Culture Many definitions have been suggested for organizational culture. Broadly speaking, organizational culture refers to the fabric of values, beliefs, assumptions, myths, norms, goals, and visions that are widely shared in the organization (French, 1998). An organization can have a single culture, although there are often subcultures within the organization. Among health care organizations, for example, we would expect to see cultural differences between a large teaching hospital and a small, rural medical practice. Within an organization, teams themselves can develop their own culture; as with ethnic cultures, these organizational cultures may include rituals, a specific language, particular modes of communication, and unique systems of rewards and sanctions. Organizational culture has a number of implications for teams. First, effective teams are usually characterized by a culture that is respectful and supportive of team members, with appropriate levels of empowerment.

First, effective teams are usually characterized by a culture that is respectful and supportive of team members, with appropriate levels of empowerment. In a QI team, for example, we would hope to see a culture characterized by interdisciplinary respect, open communication, and a collective spirit. It would be very difficult to imagine a successful QI team that does not share these and other cultural characteristics. Consider an organization characterized by intense and dysfunctional competition, low staff participation in decision making, and interprofessional rivalries and antagonism. We can consider this type of organization as having a dissonant culture (Fleeger, 1993). Notwithstanding the skills of an effective team leader, can we really expect team members drawn from such an environment to perform effectively on a multidisciplinary team? It’s more likely that team member attitudes would mirror their attitudes and behaviors outside the team. Team members would probably exhibit distrust, a “them vs. us” norm, and skepticism about their role in decision making. Consider the behavior and attitudes of team members drawn from a positive or consonant culture. We would expect team members to bring with them the very supportive Resources and Support 189 cultural attributes of the larger organization; this would contribute to team growth and performance. We can see how the larger organizational culture can be viewed as a resource: The larger culture can be highly supportive, unsupportive, or destructive to the work of the team. Although challenging, a team can develop a strong and appropriate culture while enmeshed in an organization with a contrary culture. This is not ideal and requires leadership that can help to build a team culture that does in fact serve the interests of team effectiveness. Changing Culture Cultures are very difficult to change, so team leaders and participants must understand the impact of the culture of the larger organization on the work and culture of the team. Team members’ negative or dysfunctional attitudes may simply reflect how they are treated in the larger organization. Team leaders should acknowledge the difficulty of leading a participative improvement team within a larger organizational culture that is nonparticipative and autocratic. Staff who work in a rigid, overbearing culture are likely to become skeptical when suddenly asked to participate in decision making, wondering whether their opinions will be valued, and so forth.

QI efforts in health care often confront this contradictory culture issue, experiencing the difficulties of attempting to introduce a culture that is inconsistent with the dominant organizational culture. In the state regulatory agency case (CASE STUDY 6.3), there was a culture that stressed the importance of customer relations. Value was placed on the need to provide accurate and timely information. The team that was formed to analyze and make recommendations about the problem of providing inaccurate information was motivated by the same belief in the importance of its service mission. Multiple teams were formed, each adopting this organizational culture, leading to improved communication and overall influence on policy; and ultimately more accurate information to customers. CASE STUDY 6.3: ERRONEOUS INFORMATION AT A STATE REGULATORY AGENCY The Department of Health and Emergency Services is a state regulatory agency dealing with a variety of health care professional issues. Its roles include credentialing emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, providers, and educational institutions; developing and enforcing administrative code; and serving as a primary collection point for statewide EMS data. Among its most important roles is responding to requests for information about credentialing requirements for health and EMS personnel. These requests come from physicians, hospitals, EMS providers, city and county governments, and other organizations. The agency has one main office and three regional offices. The main office has 30 staff members; each regional office is staffed by 5 to 7 people. Each regional office has a regional manager reporting to the Operations Section Chief. Since each regional office serves approximately one-third of the state, the volume of requests can be overwhelming. Each staff member is responsible for serving as primary contact for 8 to 14 counties. The agency recently learned that a significant amount of inaccurate information has been distributed by regional staff. The agency learned about this problem from complaints that inaccurate and contradictory information had been given out. For example, a hospital requested information 190 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement about how nurses could challenge the EMS exam.

The team’s goals included improving consistency among the three regional offices, ensuring accurate information distribution, and educating regional staff on agency policy. In addition to the team leader and regional office liaisons, the team also included members representing each specialty within the agency. These specialists would provide technical information about their particular specialty and serve as the primary contact for regional offices in their area of expertise. The team met monthly for 12 months to discuss issues and develop policy. One of its first tasks was to determine the underlying reason(s) for its information dissemination problem. The team obtained information from its membership and through discussions with other staff in the state and regional offices, EMS providers, physicians, and educational institutions. Information was obtained through formal and informal discussions, surveys, and a Web-based forum. Among the team’s discoveries was that staff did not have clear channels of communication with senior management and were not informed about changes in regulatory requirements. The team also learned that regional office staff were trying to be “experts” in too many different fields. The team suggested a number of changes, including the following: ■ Each regional staff member will be assigned an area of specialization; thus, each member will serve the entire region instead of 8 to 14 counties. For example, one provider specialist would be the primary point of contact for all provider issues for the entire regional office. ■ Each of these specialists will serve as the regional office representative on all statewide and intraagency committees that focus on that area of specialization. ■ Each regional manager will serve on a committee with senior management that will meet monthly to ensure that up-to-date information is distributed to each regional office. These changes were implemented at the state and regional offices. Mandatory committee attendance was difficult because of statewide travel restrictions and budget shortfalls. These obstacles were overcome by using advanced computer technology and telecommunications. Other obstacles included changes in job descriptions that were resisted by several “old timers.” Their fears were eased by giving them an opportunity to assist with writing their job description. Six months after these changes were put in place, the distribution of incorrect credentialing information dramatically decreased.

An informal telephone survey found consistent information dissemination from each regional office. Among the most successful strategies was formation of teams. This promoted consistency in information exchange and developed interagency communication between all regional offices and the main office. It was also felt that success was attributed in large part to the manner in which team members were selected and how the teams functioned. The team concept has continued to grow within the agency, and currently every staff member within the agency serves on at least one team. Some members serve on several teams and have taken on additional work responsibilities because the team approach has provided them the opportunity to have a strong voice within the agency. Senior leadership was careful not to push the team approach too fast and did not force anyone to join a team right away. Since the education team was formed first, management emphasized the work that team performed and allowed the education team to provide monthly updates to staff. This helped show that voice is important within the agency and that if staff members work together as a team, the team will have a significant influence on agency policy as well as administrative code. Resources and Support 191 Material and Nonmaterial Support and Recognition Regardless of their function, effective teams require material resources. As noted previously, material resources take a number of forms and vary depending on the goals and needs of the team. Provision of necessary material and nonmaterial support to a team is a reflection of the moral support and encouragement given a team by the larger organization and, in particular, senior management or other authority. Consider a team that is given appropriate space and time to meet, where senior managers on occasion voluntarily drop in on team meetings to provide information and support, or simply to reinforce the importance of a team’s task, and where support staff are assigned to the team to assist in its work. Furthermore, while the team is given a specific mandate and set of goals, team members collectively decide on the manner in which it carries out most of its work. Finally, upon presenting a preliminary report, detailed feedback and questions are provided the team by all relevant stakeholders. In all likelihood, team members will feel as if their work is valued and that the team’s work is indeed making a contribution to the larger organization. Consistent with the motivational and satisfying qualities of jobs defined in the Job Characteristics Model, such a team provides members with autonomy, feedback, a sense of meaningfulness, and a belief that their work is having a broad impact (Hack","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 6 - Understanding and Improving Team Effectiveness in Quality Improvement_25"}}],["793",{"pageContent":"the larger organization. Consistent with the motivational and satisfying qualities of jobs defined in the Job Characteristics Model, such a team provides members with autonomy, feedback, a sense of meaningfulness, and a belief that their work is having a broad impact (Hackman & Oldham, 1980). In sum, giving teams appropriate support can be highly motivating. Where this support is absent or ambiguous, teams will be starved for support and will be unlikely to produce at an optimal level. The state regulatory agency case (Case Study 6-3) provides a good example of how a team was provided with adequate support. Perhaps the most important resource provided was the time and energy of various individuals internal and external to the agency. Time was provided for team meetings, and team members felt that the work they were doing was worthwhile and valued by others in the larger organization. Where travel restrictions posed obstacles to team members’ ability to meet in person, computer technology— telecommunications and teleconferencing— was used. This again reinforced the importance not only of the team’s work but also of each team member’s contributions. Rewards and Motivation Related to support and recognition is the need for team and individual rewards. From the perspective of the team, rewards typically come in the form of recognition and commendation for the team’s work. In QI, team rewards usually consist of the intrinsic satisfaction of overcoming some quality challenge, that is, achieving results. Rewards may also consist of the positive feelings created by a successful team effort. Factors that contribute to team members’ intrinsic motivation are of critical importance in QI efforts (Deming, 1994). In addition to team rewards, individuals on teams need to be rewarded. Participation on teams is sometimes ambiguously defined as something between the person’s job and a voluntary effort, that is, it may not be perceived as part of a staff member’s “real job.” Job descriptions themselves may indicate little about team participation. Performance appraisals may not include team participation criteria, and compensation and promotion decisions may not take into consideration a staff member’s contribution to the work of a team. A team-oriented organization will be more likely to recognize individual contributions on teams by including teamwork in job descriptions, performance appraisal systems, and incentive compensation programs. Team-oriented organizations may also provide training in teamwork. Rewards are therefore important from the perspective of both the team and its individual members.

As with team recognition these concepts represent intrinsic individual rewards that have a strong impact on motivating team members to achieve quality outcomes (Deming, 1994). A key step in this process of ensuring intrinsic motivation is empowerment of team members in order to achieve their highest levels of performance (Daft, 2015). Members of the state regulatory agency team from Case Study 6-3 were able to see the consequences of their work, namely, a substantial decrease in the amount of erroneous information provided and better relations with their customers. Team members also saw their recommendations put into action, which communicated to team members the value of the team’s work. This set the stage for a more team-focused agency and the likelihood that future team efforts would meet with success. ▸ Team Processes Team processes refer to those aspects of the team dealing with leadership, communication, decision making, and member and team learning. Each of these factors can have an important impact on the effectiveness of a team. Team Leadership Ideally, the leader of a QI team should have thorough knowledge of the organization and the problem being addressed, as well as the authority to implement changes and overcome barriers to implementation. The leader should also have an appreciation of the implications of suggested changes on other units in the organization, as well as authority over all areas affected by proposed changes. Finally, the leader should be authorized to allocate space, time, and human resources to the team (HRSA, n.d.). As noted, these are ideal conditions, but there are times when the team leader is appointed or emerges from group deliberations. Individuals assuming team leader roles may lack some of these characteristics. Absent these qualities, successful teams require support from key people outside of the team who are in actual positions of authority. These are discussed later in the chapter in a section devoted to external support.

Discussion on leadership below applies to team leaders who have the formal authority as described above, as well as leaders who lack many of these qualities. Leadership has taken on many meanings through the last century, with early writing on leadership emphasizing plans, details, roles, budgets, processes, and schedules. These perspectives were based in an era when technology was simple and predictable, products and customers were uniform, and scientific principles could be applied to work to maximize productivity. The legacy of this era is still with us, evidenced by management attitudes toward workers and the use of fear as a means of controlling workers. We are, of course, in a very different era in which uncertainty and unpredictability are normal, and where the ability of an organization or team to be successful requires it to put itself in a position to learn. Where a team task is clear and unambiguous, a top-down leadership style may be justified, although even in such settings, input from team members may be valuable. In essence, the traditional role of a leader in low-uncertainty settings is to see that the job is done and that team members communicate and coordinate their work. In the QI area, however, leadership must take on a different look. Quality improvement is based on learning and discovery; while the team leader should be very knowledgeable about the issues under examination, no one person has all of the information to solve or even identify the sources of quality challenges. QI is by definition ambiguous and is largely a problem-solving process. Team members participate on a QI team because they have expertise relevant to the problem. Team members do not need to be told what to do, but rather Team Processes 193 encouraged to participate actively in identifying problems, analyzing causation, developing interventions, evaluating the impact of change, and so forth. Team members are brought onto a QI team because no single person has the expertise to solve a particular problem. Team member passivity is most definitely not an appropriate strategy. In an era where uncertainty is the norm, leadership styles are required that emphasize eliciting information from others, sharing of information, and using that information to collaboratively design change initiatives. In sum, the need for a participative style of leadership is unavoidable if we hope our teams be effective. Learning how to use a participative leadership style is not easy, and it is much easier to exercise an autocratic style, although it is doubtful that this style will result in positive outcomes.

Learning how to use a participative leadership style is not easy, and it is much easier to exercise an autocratic style, although it is doubtful that this style will result in positive outcomes. A participative leader does not simply listen to others but encourages and seeks out information from team members and individuals outside of the team (Daft, 2015). A participative leader must recognize that teams have both formal and informal leaders. A sports team, for example, may have a coach or manager, but there clearly can be informal leaders, usually not specifically appointed as such, but nevertheless assuming a leadership function. A multidisciplinary health care team may have a nominal team leader, but typically power and authority flow to nonleaders who have specialized knowledge or expertise; this is the root of the concept of empowerment (Daft, 2015). A leader must be able to recognize informal leaders, ascertain how to best use their expertise and authority, and empower team members to apply their expertise and authority for the good of the team.

These providers sometimes work independently, but more often than not work in concert to CASE STUDY 6.4: FORMATION OF A MEDICAL CENTER SERVICE LINE TO ADDRESS NEEDS FOR COMMUNICATION AND QUALIT Y IMPROVEMENT Jones Hospital is an academic medical center with 850 beds and an operating budget of more than $1 billion. In 1998, the hospital decided to develop service lines in an effort to better coordinate administrative, clinical, and business development needs of the institution. The objectives of this initiative were to integrate hospital and physician practice operations and bring together support services in an effort to develop more efficient and effective operational planning, market development, and patient-care QI. To accomplish this, the hospital divided all functional areas into 13 service lines, one of which was the Oncology Clinical Service Unit (CSU). This CSU encompassed, among others, inpatient medical oncology units, radiation oncology, and the adult bone marrow transplant program. A few of the organization’s goals were realized in the first 4 years after the creation of the CSU structure: communication among functional areas was enhanced, identification of strategic opportunities was improved, and day-to-day management was stronger.

However, expectations were not met regarding strategic plan development, collaborative business plan development, resource allocation, and revenue management. It was noted that the challenges of meeting organizational goals were in part due to the continuing decentralized management of several critical areas. Even with the creation of the CSU, other oncology areas remained independent of the service line: The Jones Oncology Network, the NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Tumor Registry, 194 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement the Cancer Protocol Coordination Team, the medical school clinical departments, and the faculty practice plan’s outpatient clinics. These, along with various support functions such as Management Engineering and Medical Center Finance, were critical to success with oncology strategy and operations. Yet there was no structure that pulled the various constituencies together to work toward improving cancer patient care. To address this problem, the medical center conducted a review of all oncology service areas and related support functions, including an assessment of specific challenges attributable to the current infrastructure. The review and assessment revealed operational fragmentation due to a lack of coordination and communication, independent priority-setting among areas, few changeimplementation efforts, and a misalignment of incentives regarding both compensation and patient flow. Furthermore, the review pointed to the near impossibility of developing strategic and business plans for growing patient populations since there was not an agreed-upon process for developing and approving such plans among the many stakeholders. In response, the CSU developed an internal program model to enhance efficiency and effectiveness by taking a patient-centered, QI approach. Based on the major cancer patient populations, specific programs were created inside the CSU, including the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program, the Breast Oncology Program, the GI Oncology Program, and the GYN Oncology Program, among others. Each program operated using a matrix model centered on the cancer patient experience (Grove, 1995). This structure allowed the CSU and others to focus on the needs of specific patient populations regardless of location or type of service. It reduced the organizational unit to a more manageable size in which problems could be more easily identified, analyzed, and solved by the people who were (1) the most familiar with the specific needs of each type of patient and (2) the most capable of developing a solution.

The Strategic Governance Council addressed issues of strategic direction and included the most senior physician from each of the major areas of oncology in addition to the senior administrator from the service line, physician practice plan, oncology clinics, and oncology outreach program. This council set the strategic direction and approved all plans in a well-defined planning process.

We can see that the style of leadership most appropriate in QI is one that emphasizes participation and that builds trust among team members. It is a style that encourages members to express their views and to take risks, and that develops the team and helps it to become mature and more effective. All of these characteristics can be seen in the Jones Hospital oncology service line. Leadership must also focus on keeping people engaged, motivated, and stimulated to create and innovate. Quality improvement teams are, if not voluntary, dependent upon the goodwill of participants for their success. Some successful teams encourage shared leadership by allowing specific individuals on a team to take on leadership roles for particular phases of the QI process. The overall leader therefore also assumes a training role, helping to develop team members’ skills in team leadership and project management. In sum, a participative leadership style is required not because it is humane and fosters a happy workforce (although it is likely to do so), but because team members’ active participation is absolutely essential to success. Because QI teams often do not exist within the formal hierarchical structure of the organization, team leaders must be conscious of the impact of formal and informal lines of authority, on team member motivation and commitment. Communication Networks and Interaction Patterns A key maintenance task in any team is the exchange of information. Methods of communication are essential and central in any team activity, whether it is an operating room team, a string quartet, a sports team, or a QI team. Communication is necessary not only within the team but also between the team and the larger external environment, including other teams. Communication is critical and cannot be left to chance. Consider the consequences, for example, of there being no formal means of communication between attending physicians and nursing staff in a hospital—or if there were no forum for communication among the 30 or more oncology programs at Jones Hospital. This is actually what drove Jones Hospital to completely restructure its organization to a service-line format. Communication and coordination deficiencies were identified as the underpinning factors contributing to less-than-optimal performance, declining patient care coordination and patient satisfaction, and a perception of reduced quality of care.

In any team, information must be conveyed, and a key question is, how? And how effectively and accurately is the information that is being exchanged? A key concept to help with understanding how to achieve the highest levels of communication is that information exchange requires responsibilities of both the sender and receiver of information. This is especially true in teams where exchanges between team members and team leaders do not rely solely on the hierarchy implied by a team structure, but also on the expertise of each team member. One way to ensure optimal exchange between senders and receivers of information is to make use of the important concept of active listening. Active listening requires drawing out of opinions of fellow team members, through open and deliberative stances that are nonjudgmental, and may require asking clarifying questions and other skills to reduce distortions that prevent mutual understanding. This idea relates not only to team members listening carefully to each other, but also to external stakeholders (Sapienza, 2004). To ensure that communication is carried out in the most effective manner, teams—and especially QI teams—require a communication 196 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement structure. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of health care quality problems reside in communication structure problems in the organization. Communication networks come in several varieties, and each situation demands a different type of communication structure (Longest & Young, 2006). Where the team task is simple, it may be most efficient to use a centralized structure in which information passes from the team leader to other team members. Alternatively, information can be passed from the team leader to another team member who, in a hierarchical manner, passes it down to the next individual. Neither of these models allows for or encourages upward communication. In other teams, one individual assumes the role of network hub and communicates with other members. Information from team members must pass through the hub in order to reach other team members. An all-channel communication structure is dense; communication lines are open and encouraged between all members of the team ( Longest & Young, 2006). Such a structure is most useful for complex situations where the work of each team member is interdependent with others’ work.

In such situations, formal lines of authority are blurred or meaningless. In teams focused on patient care, QI, research, or management, it is important for team members to have ready access to other team members, as is seen in the service line of Jones Hospital, which provides such access through formalized communication forums. Information is passed not only from the team leader but also among team members, making centralized models inappropriate. Similarly, going through an intermediary is inefficient and may use up valuable time. Quality improvement activities require a rich and dense communication structure. The work of QI teams is complex, and communication lines must be open between all members. For example, an intervention aimed at decreasing waiting time in a clinic requires interaction between clinicians on the team, support staff within the clinic, those involved in data collection, and so forth. The leader of such a team would assume the important role of ensuring that communication networks are in fact open and that team members are able to communicate with each other. Communication between a team and its external environment is also important. As an open system, teams are often dependent upon other individuals and other teams inside or outside the organization. Leaders here assume boundary-spanning roles, in which they ensure that relationships with critical outside groups are workable (Longest & Young, 2006). This is particularly important in a hospital setting, where a particular work unit’s operations are highly dependent upon interactions with other units (for example, patient-care units are highly dependent upon the pharmacy, dietary department, and so forth). The Oncology Leadership Group fills this role within the oncology service line at Jones Hospital. The Leadership Group is the broker between the oncology department and the medical center’s senior administration for such needs as major redeployments of resources to support oncology’s strategic priorities, redesign and reallocation of clinical space, or needs for changes in the operational interface with independent departments such as Pharmacy Services, which, to fit strategic and political needs, maintains an independent departmental structure in the organization. A QI team likely relies on information and resources from outside the immediate team and just as communication networks among team members are critical, so are strong and reliable networks between the team and other units and teams. An isolated team that neglects its external relations is likely to perform poorly because key relationships will not be well managed.

An isolated team that neglects its external relations is likely to perform poorly because key relationships will not be well managed. Decision Making Decision making is a task of all teams, and the manner in which decisions are made is critical to team success. Ideally, a formal systematic approach starting with free discussion and Team Processes 197 ending with full support of the entire team is a goal to be strived for in making team decisions (Grove, 1995). There are various ways to achieve this ideal, but in some cases, full consensus cannot always be achieved or needed to make correct decisions. Teams may reach decisions by consensus or voting, or team members may simply advise the team leader, leaving the final decision to the leader. There is no single, best way for a team to make decisions, and the mode of decision making often depends upon the circumstances and goals of the team. The president of a hospital, for example, may charge a team with the task of analyzing an acquisition possibility. The team may return with recommendations and options, but the final decision and accountability for consequences remains with the president. In a multidisciplinary mental health treatment team, it is likely that decisions will be based on team consensus, although the team leader (who may be the psychiatrist) may reserve the right to override the team’s recommendations. In still other teams, particularly those where there is no single person in a position of formal authority, the team as a whole may make decisions. In such situations, team members should discuss how decisions are to be made—by voting, by working toward consensus and compromise, or perhaps by deferring to the individual most knowledgeable about a particular issue to be decided. In the Jones Hospital example (Case Study 6.4), the decision-making process and the people who make the decisions are highly dependent on the decisions themselves. Depending on the nature and criticality of the issue at hand, there are decisions made by formal vote in the Strategic Governance Council, by informal consensus in the Program Meeting, and by mandate in the Leadership Group. The success of such decision making is dependent upon open communication among the members of these groups; all information is shared, and a record of decisions made is kept through meeting minutes of all bodies. When an individual has a problem with a decision made by the Leadership Group, for example, the forum for discussion of such concerns is formally built in to the service line structure via the other two groups.

Regardless of the mode of decision making, it is critical that team members understand their role in decision making. Assuming an advising rather than decision-making role is acceptable to team members as long as they do not expect to be in the position of making decisions. The decisional authority of the team and that of team members needs to be specific and clear. Teams often strive for cohesion, and in general cohesion is a positive force. Efforts should be made to develop a team such that members understand each other, are at ease communicating with each other, and feel a unified sense of purpose and solidarity. Taken to an extreme, however, cohesion can develop into conformity and “groupthink,” where team members become so cohesive that they lose their independence as free thinkers and may fear expressing views opposed to what they consider to be the prevailing team consensus (Daft, 2015). Member and Team Learning Peter Senge popularized the idea of the learning organization in his book The Fifth Discipline (1990). Briefly, a learning organization is one that proactively creates, acquires, and transfers knowledge and changes its behavior on the basis of new knowledge and insights (Garvin, 1993). The implication of this definition for teams is clear. First, effective teams continuously look for new information to improve their performance, whether new technology, new organizational processes, or new concepts. They are open to new ideas and seek them out. They do this by seeking diversity among team members, including people on teams with new expertise and alternative perspectives, and by ensuring that team members are engaged in continuous training and learning. Effective teams then attempt to use new information, ensuring that new knowledge is transferred to the team. This new knowledge is then used to change the team’s behavior in pursuit of higher levels of achievement. Teams 198 Chapter 6 Understanding and Improving Team Eff ectiveness in Quality Improvement may enhance their ability to learn and apply new knowledge through the use of a number of facilitating factors, including scanning the environment for new information; identifying performance gaps within the team; adopting an “experimental mindset,” such that team members are open to new approaches; and having leadership supportive of change.

(See Moingeon & Edmondson [1996] for a more in-depth discussion of facilitating factors.) Team and organizational learning are key aspects of QI, and it is no surprise that the capacity to learn is a hallmark of effective QI teams (Upshaw, Steffen, & McLaughlin, 2013). A QI team is faced not only with solving problems, but also with the responsibility for helping the larger organization transition into a learning organization. Effective QI teams review their own performance and the satisfaction of members and seek to develop strategies and new team management techniques that will enhance their performance. Some teams “debrief ” after each meeting to review the progress of their work and the manner in which they worked and seek to learn from this and improve their capabilities. Learning from experience and learning from the broader external environment are trademarks of effective organizations and teams. ▸ Conclusions In this chapter, we have reviewed the importance of teams and effective teamwork in health care and most importantly in regard to the successful implementation of QI efforts. Steps in team development and team processes were reviewed; these include development of balanced team relationships and equal status to ensure participation of all team members, and open communication and feedback, which will ensure efficient team performance through empowerment and high levels of motivation. Critical to the success of any team effort is the role of team leaders, who can come from within the team or from traditional leadership positions; also critical to success is developing a team’s culture. Finally, ongoing team learning was described as one of the most important aspects of teamwork in CQI; it provides a means for sharing knowledge and improving performance of a team as well as the larger organization in which the team exists.

Travaglia and Hamish Robertson It is much more important to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what sort of disease a patient has. — William Osler (Canadian physician, 1849–1919) Health systems and services around the world have one primary function: to care for the health and well-being of individuals and populations in the most effective way possible. This is true whether the people are working in a laboratory, managing a hospital, triaging at an accident or disaster site, performing cardiac surgery, or counseling a patient with schizophrenia. Whatever the setting or service, the measures of quality for the professional, staff member, team, ward, and/or service are clear. Such measures are established by a range of mechanisms, including legislation, regulatory practice, professional registration, peer and management review, government and organizational policies, guidelines, and research, and evidence- based practice. Despite all best efforts over the last 15 years, the role of the patient (and the patient’s family and carers) in maintaining and improving the quality of health care remains poorly understood (Peat et al., 2010; Schwappach, 2010). This lack of clarity arises from three sources. First, at least in part, the lack of clarity is a result of the historical, political, organizational, and managerial agendas that converge on this issue, making it difficult to define and compare the different logics, types and levels of approaches across services, systems and countries (Tritter, 2009). Second, while there exist a wide variety of policies (including, in some cases, no policy at all) and mechanisms, methods, and tools aimed at increasing patient involvement in health care, there is very limited evidence addressing their role specifically in quality improvement. As Groene and Sunol (2015) argue, patient engagement “… takes multiple forms in health care and there is not 201 a single strategy or method that can be considered to reflect best practice” (p. 563). Third, it remains difficult to connect patient involvement in health care services and the quality of outcomes either for particular individuals or for patients in general. While this lack of clarity can make the involvement of consumers in quality improvement difficult, it does not negate the importance of their involvement in continuous quality improvement (CQI).

One of the markers of CQI, compared to other quality systems, is that CQI acknowledges customer input as a vital source of evidence at every step of the improvement process. At an institutional level, health care services have sought information from customers through surveys, market research, advertising, and outreach efforts. From the health customer perspective, feedback is often measured via word of mouth referrals, complaints, service reputation, service demand, and litigation. The value of these sources of information is unquestionable. Patient or consumer “involvement” in health care, however, is about more than the collection of patient satisfaction surveys. There is an increasing recognition that efforts to increase the safety and improve the quality of care have mainly focused at the technical, managerial, or professional levels. These approaches tended to leave both the patient and the wider community outside of the improvement processes. A meta- analysis of eight public inquiries into large-scale breaches of patient safety around the world showed that there were common features in the breakdown of care. Despite the diversity of country of origin, health care system, type of error(s), and clinicians involved, several key themes were identified across the inquiries. These themes included a lack of patient and family involvement; poor communication and teamwork; and inadequate quality monitoring processes (Hindle et al., 2006). This confluence of factors points clearly to the importance of the integral involvement of patients in the CQI process. The question remains, however: How do we best gain and maximize the benefit from the active involvement of patients in the quality improvement process? In this chapter, we begin by reviewing the rationale, models, mechanisms, and current evidence base for patient involvement in quality improvement. We then present a model of patients’ involvement in health care that defines three dimensions (active to passive involvement, proactive to reactive responses, and micro to macro levels). Lastly, we consider the barriers to involvement in CQI of patients—especially vulnerable patients—and the ways in which health care services can address this issue. ▸ Patient Involvement in Health Care Improvement: A Brief Overview The call for active patient involvement in CQI activities is in line with changes to the “traditional” patient–clinician relationship that have occurred over several decades.

This space for engagement emerged as a consequence of broader social changes. We briefly consider five such changes that impacted the way in which not only patients but health care as a whole was perceived. These changes included shifts in social structures, which in turn have had an effect on the patient–clinician relationship. From the late 1960s onward, individuals and groups became more critical of institutions of power, including medicine and health care (Illich, 1974). A greater questioning of the relationship between medical practitioners and their patients as well as other clinicians has led to a decline (albeit a slow one) in medical and provider dominance (Dent, 2006; Wade & Halligan, 2004). The increasing diversity of the health professions has also meant that the disciplinary scope of the health sciences has expanded, along with types and numbers of services available (Borthwick et al., 2010). 202 Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement Several unforeseen global developments also contributed to a shift in the perceived location of health expertise. The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s produced profound social and clinical changes. Because of the rate of this condition’s progression, the patients themselves knew more about the illness than the clinicians and researchers, introducing the concept of the lay (or patient) expert (Epstein, 1995). The slow response to the scale and severity of AIDS saw some significant shifts in political policy generally and health policy in particular. Not only did communities become directly engaged in providing education about and treatment of the disease, but the attitudes and responses of health services and governments to patient involvement also changed as powerful community lobby groups emerged (Shilts, 2007). Similar trends developed in the United States in the 1990s relative to information services that became available to cancer patients and other seriously ill patients. These services continue to be rich sources of patient information, leading to greater patient empowerment. For example, the U.S. National Cancer Institute sponsors a “Cancer Information Service” that allows patients direct access to the latest information by cancer site and type, providing access to both physician- and patient-level information, including information on treatment options, treatment centers, and the latest news about clinical trials. These services can be accessed utilizing multiple modes: telephone","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement_2"}}],["810",{"pageContent":"direct access to the latest information by cancer site and type, providing access to both physician- and patient-level information, including information on treatment options, treatment centers, and the latest news about clinical trials.

These services provide patients with the knowledge to help choose and even direct the level of care they are receiving, ensuring the highest level of quality and thereby playing a direct role in quality improvement. The politicization of various social groups and their efforts to reestablish and legitimize their medical traditions as part of their disenfranchised cultures and epistemologies have contributed to the growth in calls for direct patient involvement in the governance of health care. These have combined with a growing recognition of the impact produced by differences in these groups access to and quality of care (Betancourt & King, 2003). The concept of cultural safety in health care was developed by the Irihapeti Ramsden in New Zealand and has now spread internationally as a way of conceptualizing the importance of indigenous perspectives, ideas, and values in health care systems. Ramsden’s argument was that health care systems were already political and that for disenfranchised peoples to have their perspectives acknowledged by these systems was, in actuality, a political act of both self-definition and resistance (Ramsden, 1993, 2000a, 2000b). The growth in “alternative” or complementary medicine since the 1980s has been associated with both globalization and the dissatisfaction felt by many people with mainstream medical care. It has, in effect, produced a secondary health care system, one more directly controlled by the consumer and their preferences (Mak & Faux, 2010; Senel, 2010). The emergence of invigorated cultural health traditions means that mainstream systems need to address demands for the improved recognition and inclusion of, for example, traditional healers, medicines, and conceptual health schemata in treatment regimens ( Gottlieb, Sylvester, & Eby, 2008). Where medical systems have resisted these shifts, they have often been forced by political pressure and policy shifts to make some accommodations of these more patient-centered and patient-driven approaches.

Lastly, the arrival of the Internet has changed patients’ access to information in quite profound ways. Patients now have readily accessible information about their conditions from an expanding range of sources (Bylund et al., 2010). They can also gain information about the treatments, services, or clinicians available locally, nationally, and internationally. The media, both public and private, now produce or host regular information programs, websites, and columns addressing health care Patient Involvement in Health Care Improvement: A Brief Overview 203 concerns, treatments, and services. In addition to breaking news stories, there is now a constant stream of health-related programs ranging from documentaries to “reality” television programs on hospitals and clinicians, all the way to the cult of the celebrity clinician (e.g., Crouch et al., 2016; Jeong & Lee, 2017). Medicine has gone from the rarefied and private to the increasingly commonplace and public. It is not only patients and the media who make use of these technologies. Health departments and services exhibit growing use of websites and social networking sites to distribute information. Prominent clinicians also use the technology; for example, Atul Gawande, a leading patient safety researcher, has a regular column in The New Yorker. Other researchers and practitioners use iTunes to disseminate their messages to clinicians and patients alike. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) offers an online interprofessional educational community for clinicians and students wanting to learn more about quality and safety. For patients, the Internet has produced another profound effect. It has become a platform through which support and discussion groups have emerged. Even individuals with the rarest of conditions (given access to computers and the Internet) now have access to forums where they can describe and discuss both the symptoms and the progression of their illness; moreover, they can compare the type and quality of their treatments with patients experiencing the same or related conditions. Similarly, people acting as carers for patients who may be too ill to seek their own information directly can also seek support and assistance from people in similar situations. ▸ Rationale for Patient Involvement in CQI As social and clinical relationships were changing, there was also increasing public awareness and disquiet about the incidence of medical errors.

Most quality and safety practitioners and academics in the United States associate the birth of the current patient safety movement with the Institute of Medicine’s To Err Is Human report (IOM, 2000). Although it was presenting data about error rates from a much earlier study by Brennan et al. (1991), the IOM report galvanized health care systems around the world into action; the report’s metaphor of hospital errors being the equivalent of a “jumbo jet full of patients crashing every three days” drew widespread media and public attention. Around the same time, a series of highprofile cases of negligence, incompetence, and/or medical homicide began to appear in the press. The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry (pediatric cardiac surgery) and Shipman inquiry (general practice) in the United Kingdom (Department of Health, 2001; Smith, 2005), the Cartwright inquiry (cervical screening) in New Zealand (Cervical Cancer Inquiry, 1988), and the Manitoba Coroner’s Inquest (pediatric cardiac surgery) in Canada (Sinclair, 1994) were just some of the cases that increased public anxiety about the quality and safety of health care internationally. More recently, the Mid- Staffordshire Hospital Inquiry in the United Kingdom has shown the devastating impact of a lack of quality control (Francis, 2013). Added to these two factors were rising levels of complaints and litigation faced by health services, both public and private. The scene was set for new approaches to safeguarding patients. Early on in the development of the patient safety movement, Vincent and Coulter (2002) asked the question “Patient safety: what about the patient?” Their argument was that “… plans for improving safety in medical care often ignore the patient’s perspective” (p. 76) and that the active role of patients in the safety of their care was something that health care services and clinicians needed to acknowledge and encourage. Patient involvement in CQI and other quality and safety strategies therefore reflects a profound change in the health service approaches 204 Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement to the provision of care. Health systems and clinicians now recognize that patients and their families can no longer be treated as completely passive recipients of care.

Health systems and clinicians now recognize that patients and their families can no longer be treated as completely passive recipients of care. In addition to the ethics involved in this traditional approach, this new perspective has a strong practical element. Patient involvement is about ensuring the accountability and transparency of services (Emanuel & Emanuel, 1997; Forrest, 2004). It is about the provision of patient-centered, as opposed to clinician-centered, care (Berntsen, 2006; Robb et al., 2006, Kitson et al., 2013), to the point more recently where health care services and clinicians have begun to work collaboratively on the codesign (Donetto et al., 2015), coproduction (Batalden et al., 2016), and redesign (Baker et al., 2016) of health care services and programs. But it is equally about joining with patients as partners in the constant vigilance and heedfulness required to protect against errors. Simply stated, practitioners, services, and managers needed to more actively listen to and engage with patients throughout the entire health care process. ▸ Methods for Involving Patients in CQI What does patient involvement look like? The answer depends largely on the level and type of system under consideration. One way of assessing patient involvement in CQI is to focus on three levels [after Bronfenbrenner (1979)]: micro (direct clinician–patient interactions), meso (health service or system level), and macro (national or international). Micro-Level Patient Involvement At a micro level, patients are directly involved in the decision making and management plans associated with their individual treatment, as well as in ensuring that the intended treatment is given as planned and according to established protocols (that is, in the monitoring of the quality and safety of their care) (Longtin et al., 2010; Peat et al., 2010). Here, terms such as engaged, active, vigilant, or empowered are applied to the patient as health services seek to assist patients in improving their health literacy and supporting them, wherever possible, to take on a self-management role ( Anderson, 2007; Coulter & Elwyn, 2002; Entwistle & Quick, 2006). Over the last decade the idea of personalization has been introduced and is closely associated with the CQI concept of mass customization (McLaugh","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement_6"}}],["814",{"pageContent":"7; Coulter & Elwyn, 2002; Entwistle & Quick, 2006). Over the last decade the idea of personalization has been introduced and is closely associated with the CQI concept of mass customization (McLaughlin & Kaluzny, 2006). Personalization is a term that has been used in various industries, especially the computer industry. The association between personalization and mass customization is discussed in detail by Tseng and Piller (2003), who describe personalization as going beyond the traditional definition of customization by involving customers (patients) in intense communication and high levels of interaction (between customers and suppliers), including negotiating the selection of services with the customer (see Chapter 1). This terminology has begun to be adopted in medical care (Hamburg & Collins, 2010), by expanding the inclusion of patient preferences through the individualization of care and shared decision making ( Barratt, 2008; Robinson et al., 2008). Patients are increasingly involved in collaborating with clinicians to reach accurate diagnoses, decide on appropriate treatment and/or management strategies, choose a suitably experienced and safe provider, and in ensuring the appropriate administration and monitoring of, and adherence to, treatments or directions (DiGiovanni, Kang, & Manuel, 2003; Ubbink et al., 2009). At this level, patients can also contribute to reducing the inappropriate use of health care resources (such as the overuse of medications, including antibiotics), which in turn can potentially reduce health care errors (Smith, 2009) and the spread of antimicrobial resistance (McCullough et al., 2015). Patients have increasingly been called on to identify and notify unsafe acts on the part Methods for Involving Patients in CQI 205 of clinicians, including, for example, a lack of hand hygiene (Bittle & LaMarche, 2009; Seale et al., 2015). As with self-management of chronic conditions, patients are most often encouraged to participate in quality improvement programs through a combination of awareness raising, information, and educational programs (Anthony et al., 2003), including participation in social marketing programs (see Chapter 8). Meso-Level Patient Involvement At the meso level, patient involvement in CQI is about increasing the appropriate, effective, and safe provision of services (Bate & Robert, 2016).

As consumers or customers, patients involved at this level are engaged in the planning, management, and evaluation of anything from entire health systems (Mockford et al., 2012) down to individual services (Donetto et al., 2015). Such participation can also take a variety of forms. Individuals can be involved as members of the public, as patients, as caregivers or family members of individuals receiving care, as representatives of consumer organizations (such as advocacy and self-help groups), and as members and representatives of population groups or communities (Anderson, Shepherd, & Salisbury, 2006; Murray, 2015). The perceived effectiveness of this last type of participation has been attributed (by patients) to their own participatory behavior and the availability of institutional participatory spaces—that is, the “opening up” of CQI mechanisms to patient involvement (Delgado-Gallego & Vazquez, 2009). It is important to note that there are criticisms of the “representativeness” of consumers, in particular that the patients involved tend to be either “professional” consumers or individuals who often more closely mirror the socioeconomic and educational profiles of health care professionals than of other social groups (Coulter, 2002). The mechanisms by which they are involved also vary. Participation can be a “one-off ” involvement in a forum or workshop or attendance at a conference. Participation can occur in time-limited activities, such as membership on patient safety committees in hospitals or services, although it should be noted that there is evidence for discrepancies between the patients’ and staff ’s expectations of this engagement process (Nathan, Johnston, & Braithwaite, 2010). Participation can also be anonymous and more passive or reactive. Feedback via patient satisfaction surveys (see Chapter 4), exit interviews, or questionnaires can contribute to quality efforts, as can involvement in focus groups or complaints and compliments letters (Ervin, 2006; Mease et al., 2007).

Macro-Level Patient Involvement Macro-level involvement in CQI sees the patient involved in patient safety activities at a national or international level. Various examples exist and are discussed in the following sections. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Patients for Patient Safety movement is one example of an international strategy aimed at ensuring that the patient’s perspective is integrated into mechanisms to improve the quality and safety of care. The WHO’s London Declaration is a pledge of partnership and a core document for its World Alliance for Patient Safety (Patients for Patient Safety, 2006). For both publicly and privately funded health care around the world, public reporting on the quality of care remains a contested issue (Duckett et al., 2008). The argument for the publication of such data is that it will make patients (often, in this context, referred to as consumers) more active participants in their choice of providers (Utzon & Kaergaard, 2009). Effective public reporting is said to (1) engage and involve health care systems and services from the initiation of the reporting program, (2) ensure the data reported are of 206 Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement the highest quality, (3) provide information in a way that is accessible and appropriate to consumers, and (4) to provide clinicians with detailed information on their individual performance (Tu & Lauer, 2009). Finally, in addition to input into direct service and health system delivery issues, some countries are grappling with the involvement of consumers and the public in “upstream” areas of patient safety such as health-related research ( Forsythe, 2016). ▸ Factors Affecting Patient Involvement What evidence is available to support the involvement of patients in the quality and safety of care? Rigorous evaluations of both educational campaigns (Schwappach, 2010) and patient involvement programs (Peat et al., 2010) were found to be lacking. Available evidence indicates that although patients tend to have a positive attitude toward the idea of being involved in their safety, their actual involvement varies both as individuals (Schwappach, 2010) and between groups, particularly in the case of “minority” groups, such as immigrants (De Freitas & Martin, 2015). From the patients’ perspective, a number of factors contribute to their willingness to participate","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement_9"}}],["817",{"pageContent":", 2010) and between groups, particularly in the case of “minority” groups, such as immigrants (De Freitas & Martin, 2015). From the patients’ perspective, a number of factors contribute to their willingness to participate in patient safety and quality strategies. These include their sense of self-efficacy; their acceptance of a new, more active role as patients; the perceived preventability of incidents; and the perceived effectiveness of their actions (Peat et al., 2010; Schwappach, 2010). Health literacy is a significant factor in determining patient involvement at every level of care (Kripalani et al., 2010; Pappas et al., 2007; Peota, 2004; Rothman et al., 2009). Factors inhibiting patient involvement range from the complexity of the patient’s condition (e.g., the presence of comorbidities) to a perceived lack of confidence or skills, to broader socioeconomic issues including social status and ethnicity (Johnstone & Kanitsaki, 2009; Longtin et al., 2010). The health care setting (e.g., whether it is primary, secondary, or tertiary care, or whether the patient perceives it to be intimidating) and the actual task involved (e.g., whether “involvement” includes confronting clinicians) have also been found to contribute to patients’ willingness and ability to participate in CQI-related strategies ( Burroughs et al., 2005; Davis et al., 2007). Perceived power differentials between individuals from vulnerable communities and health services can cause anxiety, including fear of retribution. So too can the burden of being asked to represent the needs and concerns of an entire community, especially without adequate skills, support, or preparation (Abelson et al., 2004; Arnstein, 1969; Delgado-Gallego & Vazquez, 2009; Murie & Douglas-Scott, 2004). The type of illness being experienced and socioeconomic factors also contribute to health workers’ support of patient involvement. Clinicians’ attitudes toward patient involvement are influenced by organizational issues (e.g., lack of time or training) and personal beliefs; for example, they may fear losing control or specialization, or they may perceive the “stakes” as being too high (Longtin et al., 2010). Thus, the integration of patient involvement still has some","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement_10"}}],["818",{"pageContent":"or training) and personal beliefs; for example, they may fear losing control or specialization, or they may perceive the “stakes” as being too high (Longtin et al., 2010). Thus, the integration of patient involvement still has some way to go before it is central to CQI and related processes. ▸ Measuring Patient Involvement in CQI In keeping with the London Declaration, patient satisfaction surveys have been implemented in many countries in an effort to quantify some of the many nonclinical outcomes of the patient experience and to try and increase the transparency of health and medical treatments and their associated outcomes. There is an ongoing debate about whether “satisfaction” is an adequate conceptual framework for what is at stake, and other terms such Measuring Patient Involvement in CQI 207 as patient experiences have been proposed (Hekkert et al., 2009). The use of “satisfaction” measures also indicates the influence of established models in the corporate world for gaining feedback from those paying for and/ or receiving the service in question. The type of data collected lends itself to the statistical analysis of key institutional issues against patients’ demographic variables, with a prevailing assumption that objective, quantifiable data provide the necessary understanding. An important constraint is that most satisfaction surveys tend to produce relatively positive results, and institutional providers may themselves be dependent on positive indicators for funding, board approvals, and other systemic “rewards.” Thus, measuring CQI from the patient perspective is more complicated than it may initially appear. It is also clear that patient experiences, satisfaction included, can be highly individual, contextual, and fundamentally phenomenological in character—falling into the problematic “subjective” domain. Even patient responses to adverse events, up to and including disability or death, can be seen to vary enormously depending on how the health care providers respond to those errors. Consequently, the science of patient involvement generally—and patient “satisfaction” as a particular dimension of that experience— relies on a much broader understanding of what knowledge we are seeking, why we are seeking it, and how we go about acquiring the information to construct that knowledge. To rely exclusively, or even mainly, on standard quantitative measures in the highly contextualized settings that health care involves (think appendectomy vs. chemotherapy, for example) requires a richer and more sophisticated information base than generally produced from (typically) closed-ended survey instruments (see Chapter 4). In the broader context, and given the information","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement_11"}}],["819",{"pageContent":"settings that health care involves (think appendectomy vs. chemotherapy, for example) requires a richer and more sophisticated information base than generally produced from (typically) closed-ended survey instruments (see Chapter 4). In the broader context, and given the information presented in this chapter, health care experiences do not, and realistically cannot, exist on the same level as consumer- durable purchases and they must be seen as possessing a richer set of conceptual and psychometric properties. As a result, we need to acknowledge that our science of measurement in patient involvement and satisfaction needs to address that multilayered complexity more directly and informatively. In essence, there are many more potential opportunities for more direct patient and caregiver involvement. ▸ The M-APR Model of Patient Involvement Drawing on the evidence base, we have developed a model of patient involvement that spans all levels and types of health care. The M-APR model of patient involvement looks at this issue across three levels—the “Ms” (e.g., micro, meso, macro) —and across two dimensions of involvement, the “APR” (e.g., active/ proactive and passive/reactive involvement). These dimensions indicate that patient, family, and public involvement and/or feedback into CQI can be more fully achieved through a variety of mechanisms. Active participation assumes the direct and ongoing involvement of patients and their families and caregivers in CQI activities, be it direct input and decision making about patients’ individual care or the determination of ethical standards for professions or services. Passive involvement sees services and systems drawing on more removed, yet still useful, sources of patient feedback. Many services are most familiar, and comfortable, with these sources, which include patient satisfaction surveys, exit interviews, patient focus groups, and more removed information provision via service report cards. In proactive involvement, the patient is involved in attempting to actively prevent errors and directly address safety issues. These initiatives range from education and involvement in confronting potential sources 208 Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement of errors (e.g., addressing clinicians’ hand hygiene or ensuring that the surgeon marks the appropriate limb or side of the body to be operated on), to involvement in CQI strategies and programs at service levels, to decision making about research directions at state, national, or international levels.

M-APR is intended to be a diagnostic rather than a prescriptive model. TABLE 7.1 shows a summary of the model, along with some select examples. Examples, by necessity, reflect differences in publicly versus privately funded health systems. Examples of Patient Involvement in CQI In this section, we provide an overview of four very different strategies for patient involvement in CQI. These examples illustrate the different levels of the M-APR model and provide insights into mechanisms by which patients can contribute to ensuring the quality of health care for themselves and for the broader community. Example 1: Partners in Health For almost a decade, Kaiser Permanente in the United States has been promoting its Patients as Partners program. Led by Dr. David Sobel, this program focuses on the direct involvement of patients with long-term health conditions in their self-management and health literacy development. The concept is to reposition patients from being “consumers” of health services to being active partners in their own health treatment and management. The key concept is that patients with chronic conditions are already essentially responsible for 80% of their own diagnostic and treatment behaviors, and supporting this pattern can potentially improve care and save time, money, and resources. This program grew out of work in the 1990s by Kate Lorig at the Stanford University Center for Research in Patient Education on a chronic disease self-management program and patient outcomes. The program at Kaiser includes the Healthwise Handbook, initially available online, and a range of other print, online, and direct, face-to-face supports. The concept of making low- and high- intensity interventions available was developed to cover a wide range of potential supports that could be adjusted to meet both patient and situational needs (e.g., clinician training, patient mailings, telephone calls, and face-to-face support groups).

A randomized, controlled trial compared program subjects with wait-list controls. For participating patients with conditions including lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, the results showed improvements over 6 months in their exercise levels, their communication with physicians, self-reported health, and other measures. In addition, the program saw reductions in the number of hospital, outpatient, and emergency room admissions (Lorig et al., 1999). Although Kaiser is obviously a very large and influential health care provider, by its own estimate, up to 80% of the changes it implemented could also be implemented by smaller, less well-resourced providers where economics of scale and integration factors might not be as readily available (Sobel, 2003; Sofaer et al., 2009).

TABLE 7.1 Dimension of Patient Involvement in Quality Improvement: The M-APR Model 210 Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement Example 2: National Patient Safety Goals in the United States A second example of a patient involvement strategy is based on the accreditation requirements of health services and programs in the United States. The Joint Commission (TJC) has a specific National Patient Safety Goal (NPSG 13) that addresses this issue. It states that services should “encourage patients’ active involvement in their own care as a patient safety strategy,” with a more specific subclause (NPSG.13.01.01) that they should “define and communicate the means for patients and their families to report concerns about safety and encourage them to do so.” In 2010, this goal became part of TJC’s standards for accreditation of health care services. TJC published its Patients as Partners: Toolkit for Implementing the National Patient Safety Goal in 2007. This work grew out of the establishment of NPSG 13, which specifically addresses the idea of patients and their families and caregivers as having an important and tangible role in the identification of potential errors in patient treatment and care. Patients as Partners has been supported by a range of related publications aimed at improving the capacity of patients and caregivers to identify patient safety issues as they see them developing. The program also involves training packages and accreditation for health service providers, including strategies for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating their performance. As with other patient safety systems around the world, being able to capture data and quantify the results of interventions is a crucial aspect of systemic change and program validation. One of the key issues identified by TJC has been the diversity of patients, families, and caregivers in terms of their cultures and the variety of languages spoken and read. The focus on both English-language materials and materials for other important groups, such as Spanish speakers, has been integrated into the focus of this work.

The focus on both English-language materials and materials for other important groups, such as Spanish speakers, has been integrated into the focus of this work. Central to this work is not simply the shifting demographics of the United States (and other immigrant-receiving countries) but also the centrality of effective communication in patient safety improvements. If patients are to be actively engaged as partners, then key communication issues such as language have to be incorporated from the beginning. While TJC is not the only accreditation organization in the United States, it is an important organization, both nationally and internationally, in promoting patient safety and supporting the role of patients, families, and caregivers in the processes associated with patient safety’s systemic development (see Chapter 12). The establishment of tangible measures of patient involvement, in addition to other indicators, means that patient involvement is more likely to occur and produce systemic change (The Joint Commission, 2010). Example 3: Patients as Partners Program Impact British Columbia, a not-for-profit health service provider organization specifically established to work across British Columbia’s health system to support service improvement, has recently implemented a Patients as Partners program based on the British Columbia Primary Health Care Charter. The charter is predicated on the understanding that only 15% of the population has no engagement with the primary health care system in any given year. One of the program’s goals is therefore to raise the level of patient involvement and self-management through such means as outreach programs that people can access from close to home. The training programs include patients, caregivers, and health care providers. In addition, while acute care is a major focus of the health system generally, chronic conditions contribute to a large proportion of the costs of health care and high average costs per patient, especially when patients with multiple conditions are more effectively taken into account. The M-APR Model of Patient Involvement 211 The specified principles at Impact are as follows: ■ People are treated with respect and dignity. ■ Health care providers communicate and share complete and unbiased information with patients and families in ways that are affirmative and useful. ■ Individuals and families build on their strengths through participation in experiences that enhance control and independence. ■ Collaboration among patients, families, and providers occurs in policy and program development and professional education, as well as in the delivery of care. The scope of the program aims to meet tangible goals for improving patient access to self-treatment programs, including training programs","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 7 - The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement_16"}}],["824",{"pageContent":"Collaboration among patients, families, and providers occurs in policy and program development and professional education, as well as in the delivery of care. The scope of the program aims to meet tangible goals for improving patient access to self-treatment programs, including training programs for both patients and staff on self-management programs, patient satisfaction measures, and patient and staff confidence measures in utilizing the programs. The focus is on British Columbians who are English speakers, once again acknowledging the key part that communication, more broadly, and language, in particular, play in these processes of patient engagement, empowerment, and quality improvement. Beyond the individual level, communities are engaged in allowing providers to define their local community and its constituents. Broad targets are identified for outreach activities to community organizations and related bodies (health and nonhealth) and for the need to train health professionals in developing skills for community engagement (Impact British Columbia, 2007). Example 4: From Partners to Owners Historically, health services for native peoples in the United States were provided by the U.S. Indian Health Service. This did not produce successful outcomes for many groups, including the Alaskan native communities, regardless of how well-intentioned providers were. The Southcentral Foundation (SCF) and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium signed an agreement in 1999 taking over the management of all Indian Health Service programs on the Alaska Native Health Campus (ANHC). These included the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC), the Native Primary Care Center, and the Southcentral Foundation’s main administration building, as well as other facilities based in Anchorage. The realization of the goal of health service ownership by a not-for-profit organization has since seen a significant philosophical and pragmatic shift in the design and delivery of health care services to Alaskan native peoples seeking treatment at the SCF/ANHC services. The reorientation has focused on the owners/patients as the central component in the health system’s design and delivery of services. Native people were asked how they would like care to be provided, and the results have been substantial. Outcome measures were included from the outset of the change program, and key measures such as satisfaction (of patients and staff), access, quality, and utilization are all very high. The change model has also produced significant reductions in features such as patient backlogs, HIV-positive patient admissions, and emergency department admissions.

The shift from a “patient-centered” to a “patient-driven” system has produced significant and meaningful changes across the spectrum of Alaskan native health care and established a model of innovation and change management that is attracting national and international attention. The direct and practical involvement of patients has improved measures across all domains of care for both patients and providers (Eby, 2007; Gottlieb, 2007; Gottlieb, Sylvester, & Eby, 2008; The Southcentral Foundation, 2010). 212 Chapter 7 The Role of the Patient in Continuous Quality Improvement ▸ Conclusions We have shown here that the involvement of patients in the health care that they receive and in CQI is no longer in question. What is also undisputed is that, despite a decade of sustained effort by governments, services, and clinicians, medical error rates have still not significantly reduced (Wachter, 2010), and a variety of disparities in both the quality and accessibility of health care persist. Determining the best way to involve consumers in reducing those errors, improving the quality of care they receive, and maximizing the benefits of that involvement, therefore remains problematic. Each health care system and service, across the world, will rightly need to take into account its unique funding and governance structures, planning strategies, and quality improvement mechanisms in deciding which patient involvement strategy is most suitable to its needs. Whatever the particulars involved, whatever method or mechanism the service chooses, it is clear that patients will have a greater level of involvement in their care and in ensuring higher quality. The years of token involvement and a “one-size-fits-all” approach are over. The question remains how health care systems will more fully integrate patients into their CQI initiatives and what actions they will take to resolve persistent quality and safety problems. Only then, we suggest, is it likely that error rates will finally reduce.

Johnson To err is human, to cover up is unforgivable, and to fail to learn is inexcusable. — Sir Liam Donaldson he framework of health care delivery is shifting rapidly. Capital budgets and operational efficiency are critical in this time of shrinking reimbursement, increasing share of risk, and evolving models of care delivery. Modern medical care is complex, expensive, and at times dangerous. Across the world, hospital patients are harmed 9.2% of the time, with death occurring in 7.4% of these events. Furthermore, it is estimated that 43.5% of these harm events are preventable (de Vries et al., 2008; Landrigan et al., 2010). As illustrated in FIGURE 9.1, medical error is now the third-leading cause of death, following heart disease and cancer (Makary & Daniel, 2016). The rates could be debated, as they depend on the methods used in the studies as well the levels of underreporting; however, what is clear is that we need to change and improve our health care systems dramatically. Most significantly, the study of patient safety has identified the need to design better systems—ones that make sense to providers and respect their work—to prevent errors from causing patient harm (Barach & Phelps, 2013). From all perspectives—patients’ and providers’ as well as the health care system’s—the current level of Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Medical error—the third leading cause of death in the US. BMJ, 353, i2139. The goal of this chapter is to discuss how to develop reliability and resilience in health care systems while embedding a vision of zero avoidable harm into the culture of health care. Achieving this vision requires a risk management strategy that includes: (1) identifying risk—finding out what is going wrong; (2) analyzing risk—collecting data and using appropriate methods to understand what it means; and (3) controlling risk—devising and implementing strategies to better detect, manage, and prevent the problems that produce harm (Dickson, 1995).

We then discuss models of risk management, focusing on how to address the barriers to creating an effective culture of safety and engagement and present strategies for applying concepts to clinical microsystem settings.

Copyright © 2018. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC. All rights reserved. Risk Management—Background and Definitions Traditionally, risk has been seen as exposure to events that may threaten or damage the organization (Walshe, 2001). Essentially, risk is the chance of something happening that will have an impact on key elements. It can be measured in terms of consequences and likelihood. The task of risk management, therefore, becomes balancing the costs and consequences of risks against the costs of risk reduction. The goal in clinical risk management should be to improve care and protect patients from harm; however, a perverse incentive for the organization as well as for those who work within the organization is that risk management may become a financially driven exercise that is at odds with the clinical mission of the organization (Vincent, 1997). Clinical risk management is the culture, process, and structures that are directed toward the effective management of potential opportunities and adverse events. We measure risk in terms of the likelihood and consequences of something going wrong, which is in contrast to how we measure quality (i.e., the extent to which a service or product achieves a desired result or outcome). Quality is commonly measured by whether a product or service is safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient-centered (IOM, 2001). There is substantial evidence that the majority of harm caused by health care is avoidable and the result of systemic problems rather than poor performance or negligence by individual providers. The past several years have seen an increase in proposed or operative legislation, including a near-miss reporting system, changes in mandated reporting systems, and the creation of state agencies dedicated to the coordination of patient safety research and implementation of change. There is clear policy guidance and a Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018). Mclaughlin and kaluzny's continuous quality improvement in health care. Jones & Bartlett Learning, LLC.

Mechanisms have been developed to involve all stakeholders—the government, health care professionals, administrators and planners, providers, and consumers—in ongoing, effective consultation, communication, and cultural change. These cultural and regulatory devices have helped engender more trust, which is an essential element in developing and sustaining a culture of safety. Accidents Research in managing risk has focused on the culture and structure of the organization. Perrow (1984) advanced the Normal Accidents Theory, which describes accidents as inevitable in complex, tightly coupled systems such as chemical plants and nuclear power plants. These accidents occur irrespective of the skill and intentions of the designers and operators; hence, they are normal and difficult to prevent. Perrow further argues that as the system gets more complex, it becomes opaque to its users, so that people are less likely to recognize and fear potential adverse occurrences. There are three universal ingredients of accidents: 1. All human beings, regardless of their skills, abilities, and specialist training, make fallible decisions and commit unsafe acts. This human propensity for committing errors and violating safety procedures can be moderated by selection, training, well-designed equipment, and good management, but it can never be entirely eliminated. 2. All man-made systems possess latent failures to some degree. This is true no matter how well designed, constructed, operated, and maintained a system may be. These unseen failures are analogous to resident pathogens in the human body that combine with local triggering factors (e.g., life stress, toxic chemicals) to overcome the immune system and produce disease.

All human endeavors involve some measure of risk. In many cases, the local hazards are well understood and can be guarded against by a variety of technical or procedural countermeasures. No one, however, can foresee all the possible adverse scenarios, so there will always be defects in this protective armor. These three ubiquitous accident ingredients reveal something important about the nature of making care safer (Bernstein, 1996). We can mitigate the risk of adverse events by process improvement, standardization, and an in-depth understanding of the safety degradations in systems, but we cannot prevent all risk. Embracing this uncertainty and implementing the training and curriculum to cope with it, as opposed to focusing solely on minimizing it, is essential in high-risk, highly coupled industries. Outside health care, the most obvious impetus for the renewed interest in human error and impact of the organizational dynamics has been the growing concern over the terrible costs of human errors that led to disasters. Examples include the Tenerife runway collision in 1977 (540 fatalities), the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in 1979, the Bhopal methyl isocyanate tragedy in 1984, the Challenger space shuttle accident in 1986 (Vaughn, 1996), the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 (Reason, 1997), and the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 (Ingersoll, Locke, & Reavis, 2012). There is nothing new about tragic accidents caused by human error, but in the past, the injurious consequences were usually confined to the immediate vicinity of the disaster. Today, the Johnson, J.

For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa contamination of a single damaged bronchoscope potentially infected dozens of patients (DiazGranados et al., 2009). In recent years, there has been a noticeable spirit of glasnost (openness) within the medical profession concerning the role played by human error in causing medical adverse events (Millenson, 1997). The Organizational Accident Certain systems have been designed and redesigned with a wide variety of technical and procedural safeguards (e.g., operating rooms), yet they are still subject to accidents and adverse events (e.g., fire in the operating room, wrong-patient procedure, drug errors). These types of accidents and adverse events have been termed organizational accidents (Perrow, 1984; Reason, 1997). Organizational accidents are mishaps that arise not from single errors or isolated component breakdowns, but from the insidious culture change due to an accumulation of failures occurring mainly within the managerial and organizational spheres. Such latent failures may subsequently combine with active failures and local triggering factors by errant but well-meaning providers to penetrate or bypass the system defenses. In his classic study of surgical teams, Forgive and remember, Bosk (1979) demonstrates how the underlying culture acts to acculturate newcomers, encourage normalized deviance, and suppress external views for change while enabling substandard practices to go unchecked. Systemic flaws set up good people to fail (Vaughn, 1999). People often find ways of getting around processes that seem to be unnecessary or that impede the workflow. This accumulated and excepted acceptance of cutting corners or making work-arounds poses a great danger to Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Once a professional group normalizes a deviant organizational practice, it is no longer viewed as an aberrant act that elicits an exceptional response; instead, it becomes a routine activity that is commonly anticipated and frequently used (Weick, 2009). A permissive ethical climate, an emphasis on financial goals at all costs and an opportunity to act amorally or immorally, all can contribute to managerial and clinician decisions to initiate deviance (Barach & Phelps, 2013). The etiology of an organizational accident can be divided into five phases (Perrow, 1984): 1. Organizational processes giving rise to latent failures; 2. Conditions that produce errors and violations within workplaces (e.g., operating room, pharmacy, intensive care unit); 3. The commission of errors and violations by “sharp end” individuals (the “sharp end” refers to the personnel or parts of the health care system in direct contact with patients. In contrast, the “blunt end” refers to the many layers of the health care system that affect the individuals at the sharp end. These colloquial terms are more formally known as “active errors,” which occur at the point of contact between a human and some aspect of a larger system, and “latent errors,” which are the less apparent failures of the organization); 4. The breaching of defenses or safeguards; 5. Outcomes that vary from a “free lesson” to a catastrophe. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

One of the basic principles of error management is that the transitory mental states associated with error production—momentary inattention, distraction, preoccupation, forgetting—are the least-manageable links in the error chain because they are both unintended and largely unpredictable (Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson, 2006). These errors have their cognitive origins in highly adaptive mental processes (Sagan, 1993). Such states can strike health care providers at any time, leading to slips, forgetfulness, and inattention. The system must be designed with in-depth defenses to mitigate the impact of these momentary lapses in awareness and to maintain the integrity of patient care. Human Error and Performance Limitations Although there was virtually no research in the field of safety in medicine and health care delivery until the mid-1980s, in other fields, such as aviation, road and rail travel, nuclear power, and chemical processing, safety science and human factor principles have been applied to understand, prevent, and mitigate the associated adverse events (e.g., crashes, spills, and contaminations). The study of human error and of the organizational culture and climate, as well as intensive crash investigations, have been well developed for several decades in these arenas (Rasmussen, 1990; Sagan, 1993). The presumption of the nonlinear and increasing risk in health care, associated with an apparent rise in the rate of litigation in the 1980s and attributable to the media’s amplified attention to the subject, has brought medical adverse events to the attention of both clinicians and the general public (Kasperson et al., 1988).

These developments have led to a much broader understanding of accident causation, with less focus on the individual who commits an error at the “sharp end” of the incident and more on preexisting organizational and system factors that provide the context in which errors and patient harm can occur. An important consequence of this has been the realization that rigorous and innovative techniques of accident analysis may reveal deep-rooted, latent, and unsafe features of organizations. James Reason’s “Swiss cheese” model captures these relationships very well (Reason, 1990).

Models of Risk Management Risk management deals with the fact that adverse events, however rare, do continue to occur. Furthermore, risk management as a concept means that we should never ignore the possibility or significance of rare, unpredictable events. Using a creative analogy, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2010) argues that before Europeans discovered Australia, there was no reason to believe that swans could be any color but white. However, when they discovered Australia, they found black swans. Black swans remind us that things do occur that we cannot possibly predict. Taleb continues the analogy to say that his “black swan” is an event with three properties: (1) the probability is low based on past knowledge, (2) the impact of the occurrence is massive, and (3) it is subject to hindsight bias; that is, people do not see it coming, but after its occurrence, everyone recognized that it was likely to happen. In general, risk management models take into consideration the probability of an event occurring, which is then multiplied by the potential impact of the event.

What are the ingredients and key values of a safety culture? While national cultures arise largely out of shared norms and values, an organizational culture is shaped mainly by shared practices. And practices can be shaped by the implementation and enforcement of rules. Culture can be defined as the collection of individual and group values, attitudes, and practices that guide the behavior of group members (Helmreich & Merritt, 2001). Acquiring a safety culture is a process of organizational learning that recognizes the inevitability of error and proactively seeks to identify latent threats. Characteristics of a strong safety culture include (Pronovost et al., 2003): 1. A commitment of the leadership to discuss and learn from errors 2.

Incorporation of nonpunitive systems for reporting and analyzing adverse events Striving for a safety culture is a process of collective learning. When the usual reaction to an adverse incident is to write another procedure and to provide more training, the system will not become more resistant to future organizational accidents. In fact, these actions may deflect the blame from the organization as a whole. There is a long tradition in medicine of examining past practices to understand how things might have been done differently. However, morbidity and mortality conferences, grand rounds, and peer reviews share many of the same shortcomings, such as a lack of human factors and systems thinking, a narrow focus on individual Johnson, J.

If clinicians at the sharp end are not empowered by managerial leadership to be honest and reflective on their practice, rules and regulations will have a limited impact on enabling safer outcomes. Health care administrators need to understand the fundamental dynamics that lead to adverse events. Employing tools such as root cause analysis and failure mode and effects analysis can help clinicians and others better understand how adverse events occur, but only if done in an open and safe manner (Dekker, 2004).

It is indistinguishable from a full-fledged adverse event in all but outcome (March, Sproull, & Tamuz, 2003). Near-misses offer powerful reminders of system hazards and retard the process of forgetting to be afraid of adverse events. A comprehensive effort to record and analyze near-miss data in health care has, however, lagged behind other industries (e.g., aviation, nuclear power industry) (Small & Barach, 2002). Vital but underappreciated studies suggest that near-misses are quite common. In a classic study, Heinreich (1941) estimated there are approximately 100 near-misses for every adverse event resulting in patient harm. A focus on learning from near-misses offers several advantages (Barach & Small, 2000): 1. Near-misses occur 3–300 times more often than adverse events, enabling quantitative analysis. Johnson, J.

Recovery strategies can be studied to enhance proactive interventions and to deemphasize the culture of blame. 4. Hindsight bias is more effectively reduced.

Applying Risk Management Concepts to Improving Quality and Safety Within the Clinical Microsystem The clinical microsystem as a unit of research, analysis, and practice is an important level at which to focus patient safety interventions. A clinical microsystem has been defined as a small team of providers and staff providing care for a defined population of patients (Mohr, 2000; Mohr & Batalden, 2002; Mohr, Batalden, & Barach, 2004). Most patients and caregivers meet and work at this system level, and it is here that real changes in patient care can (and must) be made. Errors and failure occur within the microsystem, and ultimately it is the well-functioning microsystem that can prevent or mitigate errors and failure to avoid causing patient harm. Safety is a property of the clinical microsystem that can be achieved only through a systematic application of a broad array of process, equipment, organization, supervision, training, simulation, and teamwork changes. The scenario included in EXHIBIT 9.1 illustrates a patient safety event in an academic clinical microsystem and how the resulting analysis enables a microsystem to learn from the event. Throughout the story, as told from the perspective of a senior resident physician in pediatrics, there are many process and system failures. EXHIBIT 9.1 Patient Safety Scenario—Interview with a ThirdYear Pediatrics Resident Resident: I had a patient who was very ill.

We thought that an abdominal CT would be helpful, and it needed to be infused. He was a very anxious child. Understandably, it’s hard for the nurses, and for me, and for his mother to deal with. He thought of it as pain, but it was anxiety, and it responded well to anxiolytics. When I came in that morning, it hadn’t been passed along to nursing that he was supposed to go to CT that morning. I heard the charge nurse getting the report from the night nurse. I said, “You know that he is supposed to go for a CT today.” She was already upset because they were very short staffed. She heard me and then said that she was not only the charge nurse, but also taking care of two patients, and one had to go to CT. She went off to the main unit to talk to someone. Then she paged me and said, “If you want this child to have a scan, you have to go with him.” I said, “OK.” Nurses are the ones who usually go. But it didn’t seem to be beyond my abilities . . . at the time. So, I took the child for his CT and his mom came with us.

My patient got more and more anxious and was actually yelling at the techs, “Hurry up!” We went into the room. He was about 5 or 6 hours late for his study, and we had given him contrast enterally. The techs were concerned that he didn’t have enough anymore and wanted to give him more through his G-tube.

As soon as I had finished the second syringe I realized I was using the wrong tube. I said, “Oh no!” Mom was right there and said, “What?” I said, “I put the stuff in the wrong tube. He looks OK. I’ll be right back, I have to call somebody.” I clamped off his intravenous line and I called my attending and the radiologist. My attending said that he was on his way down. The radiologist was over by the time I had hung up the phone. My patient was stable the whole time. We figured out what was in the gastrografin that could potentially cause harm. We decided to cancel the study. . . . I sent the gastrografin—the extra stuff in the tubes—for a culture just in case he grew some kind of infection and then we would be able to treat it and match it with what I had pushed into the line. I filled out an incident report. I called my chiefs and told them. . . . They said, “It’s OK. He’s fine, right?” I said, “Yes.” They came up later in the evening just to be supportive. They said, “It’s OK. It’s OK to make a mistake.” Interviewer: What was your attending’s response? Resident: The attending that I had called when I made the mistake said, “I’m sorry that you were in that situation.

Resident: The nurse that had sent me down with him told me, “It’s OK, don’t worry about it.” The others just listened politely and didn’t say anything.

Many methods are available to explore the causal system at work (Dekker, 2002; Reason, 1995; Vincent, 2003; Vincent, TaylorAdams, & Stanhope, 1998), and they all suggest the importance of holding the entire causal system in our analytic frame, not just seeking a “root” cause. One method that we have found to be useful for systematically looking at patient safety events builds on William Haddon’s (1972) overarching framework on injury epidemiology (Mohr et al., 2003). Haddon, as the first Director of the National Highway Safety Bureau (1966–1969), is credited with a paradigm change in the prevention of road traffic deaths and injuries moving from an “accidental” or “pre-scientific” approach to an etiologic one. Haddon was interested in the broader issues of injury and system failures that results from the transfer of energy in such ways that inanimate or animate objects are damaged. The clinical microsystem offers a setting in which this injury can be studied. According to Haddon (1970), there are a number of strategies for reducing losses: ■ Prevent the marshaling of the energy. ■ Reduce the amount of energy marshaled. ■ Prevent the release of the energy. ■ Modify the rate or spatial distribution of release of the energy. ■ Separate in time and space the energy being released and the susceptible structure. ■","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 9 - Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 9 - Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Chapter 9 - Assessing Risk and Preventing Harm in the Clinical Microsystem_16"}}],["853",{"pageContent":"of the energy. ■ Reduce the amount of energy marshaled. ■ Prevent the release of the energy. ■ Modify the rate or spatial distribution of release of the energy. ■ Separate in time and space the energy being released and the susceptible structure. ■ Use a physical barrier to separate the energy and the susceptible structure. ■ Modify the contact surface or structure with which people can come in contact. ■ Strengthen the structure that might be damaged by the energy transfer. ■ When injury does occur, rapidly detect it and counter its continuation and extension.

All rights reserved. ■ When injury does occur, take all necessary reparative and rehabilitative steps. All these strategies have a logical sequence that is related to the three essential phases of injury control relating to preinjury, injury, and postinjury. Haddon developed a 3 × 3 matrix with factors related to an auto injury (human, vehicle, and environment) heading the columns and phases of the event (preinjury, injury, and postinjury) heading the rows. FIGURE 9.3 demonstrates how the Haddon Matrix can be applied to analyze an auto accident (Haddon, 1972). The use of the matrix focuses the analysis on the interrelationship between the factors and phases. A mix of countermeasures derived from Haddon’s strategies is necessary to minimize injury and loss. Furthermore, the countermeasures can be designed for each phase—pre-event, event, and postevent—similar to designing mechanisms to preventing patient harm. This approach confirms what we know about adverse events in complex health care environments—it takes a variety of strategies to prevent and/or mitigate patient harm. Understanding injury in its larger context helps us recognize the basic nature of “unsafe” systems and the important work of humans to mitigate the inherent hazards (Dekker, 2002). Johnson, J.

Logical framework for categorizing highway safety phenomena and activity. J Trauma, 12(2), 197. We can also use the Haddon Matrix to guide the analysis of patient safety adverse events. Adapting this tool from injury epidemiology to patient safety, we have revised the matrix to include phases labeled pre-event, event, and postevent instead of preinjury, injury, and postinjury. The revised factors, patient–family, health care professional, system, and environment, replace human, vehicle, and environment. Note that we have added a fourth factor, system, to refer to the processes and systems that are in place for the microsystem. This addition recognizes the significant contribution that systems and teams make toward harm and error in the microsystem. “Environment” refers to the context (enablers and barriers) that the microsystem exists within.

FIGURE 9.5 Patient Safety Matrix with Tools for Assessing Risk and Analyzing Events Microsystems and Macrosystems Health care organizations are composed of multiple, differentiated, variably autonomous microsystems. These interdependent small systems exhibit loose and tight coupling (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001). Several assumptions are made about the relationship between these microsystems and the macrosystem (Nelson et al., 2002): 1. Bigger systems (macrosystems) are made of smaller systems. 2. These smaller systems (microsystems) produce quality, safety, and cost outcomes at the front line of care. 3. Ultimately, the outcomes from macrosystems can be no better than the microsystems of which they are formed.

Promoting System Resilience Across and Between the Microsystems Microsystems usually coexist with multiple other microsystems within the organization. Patients are aware of the gaps and handoffs between microsystems as they navigate the health care system, such as when they transfer from inpatient care back into the community. Patients are aware of the challenges of “synthesizing” knowledge across the various microsystems they encounter. Models developed by Zimmerman and Hayday (1999) for understanding and supporting work on the relationships across microsystems offer insight into the generative work of interdependence. Understanding the dynamics of effective organizational relationships can be helpful in thinking about how to foster relationships between microsystems within the same organization and across differing organizations. These crossmicrosystem relationships are fundamentally related to improving handoffs, but this inquiry can also provide opportunities for learning about systemic problems within the institution and interventions to improve quality and safety (Groene et al., 2012). An effective collaborative relationship is based on the underlying assumption that collaboration is a more effective approach to achieve a goal than multiple individual efforts (Toccafondi et al., 2012). Weick suggests that leaders today need to develop groups that are also respectful of the interactions that hold the group together (Weick, 1993, 1995). Resilient groups have respectful interactions that are founded on three major elements (Weick, 1996): 1. Trust—a willingness to base beliefs and actions on the reports of others 2. Honesty—reporting so that others may use one’s observations in developing and enhancing their own beliefs Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Self-respect—integrating one’s perceptions and beliefs with the reports of others without depreciating them or oneself Four aspects of the relationship can help generate creative responses to the diagnosed challenges facing entities needing to work better together (Zimmerman & Hayday, 1999): 1. The separateness or differences of the two microsystems 2. The talking–listening–tuning opportunities that the two microsystems have 3. The action opportunities that the two entities have 4. The reasons they have to work together Balanced attention to each of these aspects enables creative work. The conditions also must be present for relationships to develop across organizations (Kaluzny, 1985). For voluntary interactions— which may be quite different than those mandated by an external power—several conditions must be met. There must be an internal need for resources, a commitment to an external problem, and the opportunity to change. In addition, there must be a consensus regarding both the external problem(s) facing the organizations and the specific goals and services for developing a joint effort. The Institute of Medicine report To err is human (IOM, 2000) brought patient safety to the forefront of the agenda and set the stage for discussing specific goals and strategies for achieving those goals. Mitchell and Shortell (2000) provide a synthesis of the literature on the success of community health partnerships that suggests several factors that influence the success of interorganizational relationships.

Health care providers have a responsibility or “fiduciary duty” to act in the best interests of the patient (Kraman & Hamm, 1999). Properly assessing the type of procedure planned (e.g., invasive vs. noninvasive), patient risk factors, type of drug to use (e.g., hypnotic vs. analgesic), and type of team and level of support are all critical. When assessing the level of risk of the procedure, we should ask, What are the desired clinical effects? How quickly are effects desired? What is the desired duration of effects? And are there any adverse “other” clinical effects?

Malpractice suits often result when an unexpected adverse outcome is met with no effort to apologize, with a lack of empathy from physicians and a perceived or actual withholding of essential information (Barach, 2005; Wu et al., 1997). Studies consistently show that health care providers are understandably reticent about discussing errors, believing they have no appropriate assurance of legal protection (LeBlang & King, 1984). This reticence, in turn, impedes systemic and programmatic efforts to prevent medical errors. A growing initiative in health care has been to encourage open and frank discussion with patients and their families after an adverse event; this initiative has met with salutary effects.

Evidence from the University of Michigan supports an aggressive disclosure policy (Clinton & Obama, 2006). In 2002, the University of Michigan Health System launched a program with three components: (1) acknowledge cases in which a patient was hurt because of medical error and compensate these patients quickly and fairly, (2) aggressively defend cases that the hospital considers to be without merit, and (3) study all adverse events to determine how procedures and systems can be improved. Disclosing an adverse event should occur when the adverse event (1) has a perceptible effect on the patient that was not discussed in advance as a known risk, (2) necessitates a change in the patient’s care, (3) potentially poses an important risk to the patient’s future health, even if that risk is extremely small, and (4) involves providing a treatment or procedure without the patient’s consent (Cantor et al., 2005).

Conclusions The health care system has begun to approach patient safety in a more systematic way, but we continue to tolerate an extraordinary level of risk and preventable harm. There is a clear need to improve the safety of care, as patients still suffer harm from medical care at alarmingly high rates. Strong leadership is needed to change organizational cultures to achieve a vision of zero tolerance of preventable harm. The application of safety science and reliability principles, methods, and analytical tools in the health sector promises the development of a coherent bundle of interrelated strategies for change. Reliability principles include methods of evaluating, calculating, and improving the overall reliability of a complex system—have been used effectively in industries such as manufacturing to improve both safety and the rate at which a system consistently produces appropriate outcomes. Even the most advanced health care organizations acknowledge that they are on a journey to achieving high reliability and need to address four essential building blocks: (1) a culture devoted to quality; (2) responsibility and accountability of staff; (3) optimizing and standardizing processes; and (4) constant measurement of performance. Much organizational and leadership work is needed to change the mental model of clinicians and providers toward a system-based change. The traditional approach within medicine and health care was to emphasize the individual’s responsibility for errors and to encourage the belief that the way to eliminate adverse events was for individual clinicians to perfect their practices. This simplistic approach fails to address the important and complex systematic flaws that contribute to the genesis of adverse events, and also perpetuates a myth of infallibility that is a disservice to both Johnson, J.

The focus on the actions of individuals as the sole cause of adverse events inevitably results in continued system failures, resulting in the injury and death of patients and the tendency for clinicians to blame themselves for this harm. The efforts of the innumerable government bodies around the world to align external financial, regulatory, and educational incentives are beginning to have an impact on clinicians’ and providers’ interest in embracing the safety themes described in this chapter. Cultural and process changes require profound alterations in management thinking, staff empowerment, and communications skills within and across disciplines. Attributing errors to system failures does not absolve clinicians of their duty of care or their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their patients. In fact, acknowledging system failures adds to that duty a responsibility to admit errors, investigate them collaboratively, and participate in redesign for a safer system. One way to achieve this is to deconstruct errors and failures at the front lines of health care as a way to assess risk and develop further strategies for managing risk. Such understanding and corrective efforts can be made to embed quality and safety into the microsystem. . Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Hirschhorn It is often difficult, and indeed not always helpful, to separate intervention from context to the extent that transplanting a programme in its entirety from one setting to another is rarely straightforward. — Mary Dixon-Woods he most consistent challenges to continuous quality improvement (CQI) throughout its evolution in health care have been ensuring the broadest adoption of evidence-based improvements in practice and motivating research into further improvements of processes and outcomes.The challenge of how to maximize adoption of CQI-proven practices is addressed in this chapter through an introduction to implementation science as a methodology to increase the adoption and implementation of innovations and improvements in health care-practice settings. Drawing on its multidisciplinary roots and applications, implementation science represents a next step in the evolution of CQI in health care. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Implementation Science Defined Implementation is “a specified set of activities designed to put into practice, an activity, or program” (NIRN, 2018). Even if we know the interventions needed to implement or improve a program, we still need a scientific approach to make sure that these activities are executed in a way that results in their effective use. We also need to learn from this experience to accelerate change more broadly.

The emerging field of implementation science involves the systematic study of how to improve the quality of implementation of interventions and programs that are known to work, typically in health care, public health, behavioral health, education, and other settings where sustainable solutions at scale are difficult to achieve. Implementation science has a number of definitions, but it can be understood as the “scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidencebased practices into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and care … (this) field includes the study of influences on health care professional and organizational behavior.” Recognizing the importance of how and where these interventions are implemented, the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) also defines the field as “the study of factors that influence the full and effective use of innovations in practice” (NIRN, 2018). In this chapter, we describe the key principles of implementation science and how integrating these principles into improvement strategies can be a valuable step to helping quality improvement (QI) programs achieve their desired results. While the use of QI methods such as Lean, Six Sigma (see Chapter 5), or the Model for Improvement (introduced in Chapter Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

For example, a recent systematic review of Lean methods concluded that there is little evidence to support the claim that Lean leads to improved health care (Moraros, Lemstra, & Nwankwo, 2016). The lack of a systematic approach to implementation is one reason for this conclusion. The most common QI methodologies do not incorporate a systematic approach to the implementation of the improvement solution—a failing that can lead to an incorrect conclusion that the solution isn’t effective.

The Wall Street Journal reports that 60% of Six Sigma projects fail to achieve the desired results, because “in the middle stage of an improvement project—when the Six Sigma expert moves on to another project and top management turns it focus to another group of workers—implementation starts to wobble, and teams may find themselves struggling to maintain the gains they achieved early on” (Chakravorty, 2010). The three questions framing the Model for Improvement (FIGURE 3.2) are structured to help teams develop improvement solutions but do not address their implementation and often neglect the broader organizational changes needed for immediate success as well as sustainability of change.

In other words, it is not enough to use QI methods rigorously to come up with a solution that works. It is equally important to be rigorous about applying the approaches and tools from implementation science to put these solutions into effective practice and sustain the changes. The key ingredients needed for interventions to achieve successful outcomes are summarized in FIGURE 3.3 (Bertram, Blase, & Fixsen, 2015). Positive outcomes require an intervention that is appropriate to the context, which QI methods can help to develop. Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

An implementation approach appropriate to the setting and resources and a supportive organizational, policy, or funding environment are needed as well. The multiplicative nature of these “ingredients” means that failure in any of these steps will decrease the chance that desired outcomes are achieved. FIGURE 3.3 Key Ingredients for Achieving Outcomes Modified from National Implementation Research Network FIGURE 3.4 shows how quality improvement methods and implementation science approaches can work together to achieve effective outcomes in health care and in public health. Systematic improvement methods help to create effective interventions (sometimes referred to as change packages) that fit the local context.

Analogous to improvement aims, these outcomes specify the implementation aims to ensure quality implementation in a particular setting or context, such as feasibility, fidelity, acceptability, or cost. The second question addresses implementation determinants, or factors that may affect the implementation outcomes in that context. And finally, the third question identifies implementation strategies, which are implementation interventions to address the determinants that may impede the achievement of the implementation and ultimately the QI outcomes.

As a result of this testing, it may become apparent that the change package is inappropriate for the context and may need to be modified or adapted. This will initiate the redesign of the change package and the creation of a new improvement solution. Improvement and implementation are thus intrinsically connected in the joint model. Implementation Outcomes The first implementation question of the MFII is intimately connected to the first improvement question, What are we trying to accomplish?, because we cannot achieve health improvement goals if improvement interventions are not implemented well. Implementation outcomes are defined as “the effects of deliberate and purposive actions to implement new treatments, practices, and services” (Proctor et al., 2011). In other words, implementation outcomes measure how well the implementation process worked, since the quality of the implementation process affects how well the QI intervention achieves the desired health outcomes. There are more than 500 studies offering evidence that the quality of implementation affects health outcomes (Durlak & DuPre, 2008). Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

TABLE 3.1 Implementation Outcomes and Definitions Implementation Outcome Definition Acceptability Perception that an intervention is agreeable or satisfactory. Adoption Uptake of an intervention by practitioners or providers. Appropriateness Fit of an intervention to a particular context or setting. Cost Money, resources, time, or effort needed to implement an intervention. Feasibility The extent to which organizational resources, motivation, and capabilities can support the implementation of an intervention. Fidelity The match between how an intervention is intended to be delivered and how it is actually delivered. Penetration The extent to which an intervention reaches the population for whom it is intended. Sustainability The extent to which an intervention becomes part of an organization’s everyday practice. Quality improvement project teams can use Figure 3.6 to select the implementation outcomes most likely to affect the achievement of their improvement aims. For example, an improvement intervention that relies on fast ambulance services to improve referral processes affecting the timeliness of care may not be feasible or may be too expensive in low-resource settings where ambulance services are not easily available. In this context, feasibility and cost may be the most important implementation outcomes that affect the ability to improve timeliness of care. In the case of an intervention focusing on improving patient satisfaction by enhanced provider/patient communication, acceptability of new communication protocols by providers may be the primary implementation outcome of interest. For a hand-hygiene intervention, adoption by clinicians may affect the reduction in health care-associated infection (HCAI) prevalence. In this case, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

How should these implementation outcomes be integrated into the work of QI teams? After teams have defined the change package to be implemented as part of the QI initiative, they will consider the implementation questions in MFII and determine the implementation outcomes that are most relevant to the successful implementation of their change package. They will collect baseline measures for their selected outcomes and set targets for the implementation outcomes that will result in sustained achievement of the improvement outcome. Implementation outcomes can be measured in a variety of ways. Perceptual measures such as feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, or adoption can be measured through surveys or through semi-structured interviews or routine measurement depending on the indicators chosen. Some of these measures may be integrated into the data collection plan of the QI project without the need for additional work. For most QI projects, a simple survey with a few questions might suffice. But if more rigor is needed, validated survey instruments exist for these outcomes (Weiner et al., 2017; Roberts, Becker, & Seay, 1997). Fidelity can be measured through observations of adherence (Carroll et al., 2007) to a practice or protocol using checklists (Breitenstein et al., 2010). Cost and reach can be measured through reviews of operational documents (e.g., admissions registers or accounting records). Lewis and colleagues (Lewis et al., 2015) identified 104 instruments for measuring one or more implementation outcomes.

Guided by implementation scientists, Mercy Hospital QI teams are beginning to use the MFII to improve their quality of implementation. The evidence-based communication protocol is their first project to use the enhanced model. BOX 3.1 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 1 The QI team at Mercy Hospital seeks to increase average patient satisfaction by 25% through an improvement change package involving an evidence-based provider/patient communication protocol that has been shown to work in controlled experiments. To ensure that they can successfully implement the change package at Mercy, they talk to key stakeholders (leadership, physicians, nurses) in the facility to determine the barriers to implementation. Based on these conversations, the team determines that the greatest barrier to implementation of this protocol is provider acceptability and selects acceptability as the implementation outcome of interest. An acceptability survey administered to providers indicates that currently, only 25% of the providers consider the protocol “highly acceptable.” The team determines that at least 75% of the providers will need to find the protocol acceptable to ensure successful implementation. This is a necessary precursor to realizing the desired patient outcomes—in this case, patient satisfaction.

Nilsen (2015) identified 13 “determinant” frameworks in which the “aim is to understand and/or explain influences on implementation outcomes, e.g., predicting outcomes or interpreting outcomes retrospectively.” One of the most widely accepted of these is the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al., 2009), commonly referred to as CFIR. The framework has been tested widely in many different contexts. A systematic review identified 26 studies that have used the framework (Kirk et al., 2016). FIGURE 3.7 shows the graphic of the framework, which consists of 39 factors affecting implementation organized by five domains that are similar to those described in Table 3.2. Definitions of each of the factors are provided in APPENDIX 3.1. Extensive documentation to support the use of the framework by practitioners and researchers is available at the CFIR website. To explore how CFIR can be used to identify factors that affect implementation outcomes, BOX 3.2 returns to the hypothetical example of implementing provider/patient communication protocols described earlier.

BOX 3.2 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 2 Recall that the implementation outcome of interest at Mercy Hospital was the acceptability of the communication protocol to providers. The CFIR domains provide a systematic way of identifying the most important barriers to acceptability. Reviewing the results from the staff survey, the team determines that the individuals involved and the inner setting (i.e., organizational characteristics) are the most important determinants affecting the acceptability of the protocol. These include service provider knowledge regarding the communication protocol, their beliefs about their ability to implement it, and organizational attitudes towards change. To get a deeper understanding or these determinants, the team may conduct additional interviews with the staff and leadership of the facilities or use questionnaires to measure organizational readiness for change. Simple, locally developed questionnaires might suffice, but for those requiring rigor, several validated instruments such as the Acceptance of Change Scale (ACS) to measure individual attitudes (Di Fabio & Gori, 2016), or the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change (ORIC) instrument (Shea, Jacobs, Esserman, Bruce, & Weiner, 2014) to assess organizational motivation and capacity for implementation are available in the literature.

The drivers are shown in FIGURE 3.9 and are categorized into competencies (hiring, training, and support needed to ensure that staff are well equipped to implement), leadership (ensuring that leaders have both the management skills and the ability to adapt to changing implementation environments) and organization (use of data to drive decisions, organizational support for change, and integration of the implementation with other external policy and resource priorities).

Implementing Well: Using Frameworks for Implementation Even the best implementation strategies will not be of use unless they are implemented well. Several frameworks for guiding the implementation process exist in the implementation science literature. We will describe two that are useful to practitioners: Stages of Implementation, which is one of the AIFs described earlier, and the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation. The NIRN stages of implementation framework describes four stages through which the implementation of an intervention takes place (Bertram et al., 2015). The stages are shown in FIGURE 3.10. The Exploration Stage overlaps with some of the planning activities mentioned previously to assess organizational readiness for implementation, identify key factors affecting implementation, and develop implementation strategies. During the Installation Stage, resources for carrying out the implementation strategies are acquired, both for the actual implementation itself and for any technical support that may be required. Training of staff may also take place at this stage. The Initial Implementation is where the intervention is implemented for the first time, using the implementation strategies. The strategies themselves may be tested and adapted during this stage, and any changes to the intervention may be considered. During Full Implementation, ongoing testing and refinement may take place, but the intervention begins to get embedded in the organization and becomes part of everyday work. Johnson, J.

The stages overlap with each other, and there may be situations where there may be the need to cycle back to earlier stages based on the results of tests of strategies (e.g., if it is apparent during initial implementation that staff have not been trained adequately or are not motivated, it may be necessary to go back to some of the installation and exploration activities of staff preparation and readiness building).

BOX 3.4 Implementing an Evidence-Based Communication Protocol, Part 4 Using the Stages of Implementation Framework (Table 3.7): In the exploration stage, the QI team continues to identify factors that might affect the quality of implementation and develops a package of strategies. In the installation stage, the team may begin conversations with early adopters who might serve as champions, and test and refine the messages that these champions should disseminate to other service providers. Once the messages have been finalized, the team may test the different methods for dissemination (e.g., face-to-face presentations at staff meetings, informational flyers, video presentations, and so forth). As more departments begin to use the protocol, the champions and other staff members involved in the implementation may organize local seminars and workshops where staff can share their experiences about the implementation process. Over time, as the protocol becomes part of everyday use, staff leaders in various departments may monitor its use and continue to provide support for implementation as required and training as new providers enter the system. Using the Interactive Systems Framework: We can also use the Interactive Systems Framework to develop an implementation plan for the strategies in Table 3.6. The ISF helps to ensure that all aspects of the implementation are considered in a systematic way. As shown in Table 3.8, Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

Conclusions The purpose of this chapter is to introduce quality improvement practitioners to some of the key principles, concepts, and tools of implementation science. Over the years, the fields of quality improvement and implementation science have progressed side by side. QI methods have focused on the development of change packages and interventions with the assumption that someone else will take care of implementation or that implementation is the easy part if the intervention is sound. Implementation science has been concerned with the adaptation and implementation of evidencebased interventions, often without a real understanding","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Integrating Implementation Science Approaches into Continuous Quality Improvement.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Integrating Implementation Science Approaches into Continuous Quality Improvement","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\McLaughlin and Kaluzny's Continuous Quality Improvement in Health Care - Integrating Implementation Science Approaches into Continuous Quality Improvement_20"}}],["893",{"pageContent":"development of change packages and interventions with the assumption that someone else will take care of implementation or that implementation is the easy part if the intervention is sound. Implementation science has been concerned with the adaptation and implementation of evidencebased interventions, often without a real understanding of what the intervention is and how it has been developed. As a result, improvement interventions are often poorly implemented, and implementation science has failed to benefit from the wealth of practical knowledge about theories of systems, processes, and variation that are cornerstones of good QI practice. The intent of this chapter is to bridge this gap. QI practitioners, armed with implementation science tools will be well equipped to realize the old adage: “What is worth doing is worth doing well.” Johnson, J. K., & Sollecito, W. A. (2018).

By providing a wide database for examining relationships between nursing and patient outcomes, NDNQI delivers evidence to support the importance of investments in nursing strategy. It advances the vital efforts of nursing to help achieve higher quality, more coordinated care through a robust database of nursing-sensitive quality indicators and leading job satisfaction and practice environment Registered Nurses (RN) surveys. More than 2,000 U.S. hospitals and 98% of Magnet recognized facilities participate in the NDNQI program, demonstrating the value of nurses in promoting high quality, patient-centered care. Transforming Data into Quality Care NDNQI is recognized as the gold standard in collecting, analyzing, comparing and reporting unit-based nursing sensitive quality indicators. With powerful unit-level data, NDNQI enables action-planning and intervention for specific units needing improvement. It features nursing-sensitive structure, process and outcomes measures to monitor relationships between quality indicators and outcomes, including 18 nursing-sensitive quality indicators. Understanding Nurses Needs Nurses must be at the forefront of the mission to reduce suffering and deliver patient-centered care. Their valuable input is generated annually by Press Ganey’s NDNQI RN Survey that captures the voice of more than 300,000 nurses to provide hospitals with insights to drive engagement with those directly responsible for the patient experience. These insights can help anticipate costly nursing turnover and improve organizational culture. The unit-level focus of the NDNQI RN Survey enables hospitals to develop more effective, finely targeted improvements. This type of unit-level examination of the details also helps hospitals understand the relationship between the clinical and staffing data and the RN survey data. Road to Magnet Recognition Press Ganey worked collaboratively with the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to support the 2014 Magnet Guidelines and ensure content coverage of the seven nursing satisfaction categories required for Exemplary Practice Evidence of Outcomes. This solution offers organizations the ability to: Quarterly data submissions on nurse-sensitive quality indicators are advantageous to Magnet requirements NDNQI nursing-sensitive measures are in compliance with the Magnet Recognition Program Health care organizations can utilize the benchmarked nursing satisfaction data to fulfill the requirements of the Magnet Recognition Program How NDNQI Helps?

This has enhanced bipartisan interest in moving forward withvalue-based payment reforms. Nurses have a rich history of innovative care models that speakto their potential centrality in delivery system reforms. However, deficits in terms of educationalpreparation, and in some cases resistance, to considering cost alongside quality, has hindered theprofession’s contribution to the conversation about value-based payments and their implicationsfor system change. Addressing this deficit will allow nurses to more fully engage in redesigninghealth care to better serve the physical, emotional, and economic well-being of this nation. Italso has the potential to unleash nurses from the tethers of a fee-for-service system where theyhave been relegated to a labor cost and firmly locate nurses in a value-generating role.

In partic-ular, the pandemic laid bare the widespreadand systemic nature of health inequities in theUnited States and brought to light the real-ity of chronically underfunded public healthinfrastructure.At the heart of this failed system is fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement, whereby eachintervention, action, or service is financiallycompensated. Fee-for-service reimbursementis a major reason for the mismatch betweenneeded services and their availability, as wellas the tragic paradox of overtreatment and un-dertreatment in the United States. Under FFSreimbursement, providers are financially re-warded for thevolumeof services provided,regardless if that service hasvaluein the formof favorable outcomes. Similarly, as we haveseen during the pandemic, hospitals are ex-cessively reliant on elective procedures, par-ticularly, the most intensive and expensiveones, for financial sustainability. This empha-sis on census volume and surgery-based proce-dures as leading sources of income for hospi-tal systems has made the value of nursing caredependent on these distorted missions, ratherthan on the important areas of proven nursevalue, such as preventing never events, pres-sure ulcers, falls with injuries, and so forth.These years of perverse financial incentives,and the recognition that the skewed invest-ments in health and social spending are mak-ing it difficult to compete globally, have led toa realization that we must move to value-basedpayments (VBPs), and COVID-19 has magni-fied the need to keep moving in this direc-tion. Given how little the 2 major US politicalparties agree upon, it is encouraging that VBPreforms have widespread bipartisan support.Calls for payment reforms that emphasizevalue over volume have emerged amid mount-ing evidence of the problem of low-value careand waste in the United States, with stud-ies consistently finding 25% to 30% of careto be wasteful,3or roughly $1 trillion peryear.

While this waste is realized as incometo providers, it comes at a steep price forour nation as a whole. Taxpayers contributesubstantially through the cost of governmen-tal insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIPS, Tri-care). The expense is also borne by work-ers who receive health insurance throughtheir employer. Given cost shifting, employer-based insurance functions as a hidden tax onemployees. Moreover, employers are increas-ingly adopting insurance plans with high costsharing, leaving consumers with increasingcopayments and deductibles.In response to evidence of waste, a varietyof waste-reducing programs have been insti-tuted, and more programs are anticipated. TheTable describes some of the main characteris-tics of FFS reimbursement, episode-based pay-ment such as bundled payment, population-based payment such as Accountable CareOrganizations, and advanced primary caremodels. These, together with programs suchas Hospital Value-Based Purchasing, attemptto better align the case for quality with eco-nomic incentives. Based on experience todate with various models, the federal govern-ment is currently most interested in alterna-tive payment models that are mandatory, suchas some bundled payment programs, and in-corporating a downside risk for providers aswell as the upside savings elements.5DEVELOPING NURSING’S RESPONSE TOVBPsFor nursing, the question that has been dis-cussed for some time now is “what will pay-ment reform based on value mean for theevolving role of different types of nurses?”In theory, VBPs should mean that nurses willCopyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A2008 Robert Wood Johnson report indicatedthat fully 25% of the nation’s public healthworkforce consists of nurses.11Telehealth and mHealthTechnologies for remote sensing and com-munication through telehealth and mHealth(mobile and wireless technologies) hold greatpotential to improve access to care for peo-ple living in rural and underserved areasand to ameliorate rural and ethnic/minorityhealth disparities.12They are often deliv-ered by nurses, and the expansion of thesetechnologies, and more recently, the expan-sion of payment for these services duringthe COVID-19 pandemic has created an abun-dance of opportunities for nursing to providehealth care that can improve outcomes atlower cost.13Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Value-Based Payment183Across and beyond these models, studiesare emerging that describe how VBPs couldlead health care organizations and payers tosee nursing expertise differently.

In addition, the basisfor these programs is patient risk segmenta-tion and other big data analyses, an area oftenoverseen by a nurse serving as the director ofpopulation health.18THE COST PROBLEMWhile nurses, as individuals and as a pro-fession, have much to gain from the movetoward VBPs, there are structural, cognitive,and atavistic barriers to full adoption of value-based care by nurses. Structurally, nursesare often employed in settings with volume-driven health care, for example, hospitals.Cognitively, they have not been educationallyprepared to observe, critique, and correct fi-nancing and delivery mechanisms that drivelow-value, high-cost care. If value equals costand quality, while nurses are schooled in qual-ity, they have to start understanding cost andrisk sharing with payers. Finally, the deepestbarrier may be tied to nursing’s professionalidentity. Generations of nurses have been so-cialized to believe that their role is to focus onthe person directly in front of them and maxi-mize that person’s care; for many nurses, evenconsidering costs of care has sometimes beenviewed as unethical. The time has come tochange that mindset. It is critical for nursesto engage in the conversations about valueand to participate in and sometimes lead pro-cesses of delivery system change.Cost considerations are not inherentlygood or bad. Coupled with a focus on healthoutcomes, cost considerations are at the heartof value-based care and represent an es-sential corrective action.19Importantly, costconsideration does not inherently mean avoid-ance of expensive treatments but instead fo-cuses on the value-added health outcomethat is accomplished in response to thetreatment. Cost consideration also requirescomparison to other treatment options,including the often-ignored approach ofthoughtful and watchful waiting.

This central premise of healthcare ethics, nonmaleficence (“do no harm”),is paired with a more nuanced adoption ofbeneficence (“do good”—create a benefit).The best idea in the world cannot create abenefit if there is no way to pay for it.RECOMMENDATIONSTo address the resistance within nursing toincluding cost as an inherent element in thevalue proposition, and to enhance the roleof nurses as protagonists of systems reforms,nursing leadership must develop its own plan.The plan must attend closely to nurse ad-ministrators and nurse educators, roles thathold a particular responsibility for ensuringthat nursing is ready to contribute to thesechanges.Nurse administrators play a vital role inmaking the cost of care transparent to thehealth care team, but tracking costs is notsimple. One challenge is the difference be-tween the actual costs associated with careand supplies and what the health care agencyCopyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

For this tooccur, nurses themselves must become morevalue-conscious and thinking that to do so isnot altruistic must be eliminated.The American Organization for NursingLeadership created competencies for nursemanagers,25nurse executives,26post–acutecare,27and system chief nurse executives28that include health care economics, value-based purchasing, revenue, and reimburse-ment. However, these competencies do notexplicitly include measurement of value, in-cluding cost, outcomes, and patient satis-faction. Nurse administrator education, con-tinuing education, and competencies couldaddress this gap by adding competencies re-lating to the measurement and acumen formanaging costs while increasing access andquality.There are also opportunities to leveragechange in the incumbent nurse workforcethrough performance improvement projectsthat seek improved patient satisfaction andcare outcomes, while reducing costs throughoperational improvements. One well-knownapproach is Lean, which focuses on the re-duction of 8 types of waste: waiting/idle time;inventory; defects; transportation of patients,supplies, and equipment; motion; overpro-duction; overprocessing, and untapped hu-man potential.29In calculating the reductionof waste, nurses may need additional train-ing in cost analyses. Regardless, of the ap-proach, nurses’ professional associations andorganizations could design and offer continu-ing education modules for credit nationwideto inform the current nurse workforce (frompublic health nurses to nurse practitionersand hospital-based nurses) of the complexity,models, and benefits of value-based care.Among nurse educators, there are alsodeficits. Most have not been systematicallyprepared to analyze and reform care pro-cesses to enhance value. This makes it difficultto lead curricular redesign and student learn-ing.

In all-inclusive total cost-of-care models, the mostobverse model from FFS reimbursement, allhealth services—regardless if delivered byphysicians, nurses, or physical therapists—are costs. This shift is critical to nursing’sprofessional security, because when financialtimes are tough and cost reductions needed,as we have seen again in 2020, labor is thefirst area targeted. Nurses lose jobs.

Background The concept of ‘nursing sensitive indicators’ is valuable to elaborate nursing care performance. The conceptual foundation, theoretical role, meaning, use and interpretation of the concept tend to differ. The elusiveness of the concept and the ambiguity of its attributes may have hindered research efforts to advance its application in practice. Design Concept analysis. Data sources Using ‘clinical indicators’ or ‘quality of nursing care’ as subject headings and incorporating keyword combinations of ‘acute care’ and ‘nurs*’, CINAHL and MEDLINE with full text in EBSCOhost databases were searched for English language journal articles published between 2000–2012. Only primary research articles were selected. Methods A hybrid approach was undertaken, incorporating traditional strategies as per Walker and Avant and a conceptual matrix based on Holzemer's Outcomes Model for Health Care Research. Results The analysis revealed two main attributes of nursing-sensitive indicators. Structural attributes related to health service operation included: hours of nursing care per patient day, nurse staffing. Outcome attributes related to patient care included: the prevalence of pressure ulcer, falls and falls with injury, nosocomial selective infection and patient/family satisfaction with nursing care. Conclusion This concept analysis may be used as a basis to advance understandings of the theoretical structures that underpin both research and practical application of quality dimensions of nursing care performance. Why is this research or review needed? Recently established and valid nursing performance measurements are referred to as nursing-sensitive indicators. Many nursing-sensitive indicators can measure outcomes of nursing care. The concept of ‘nursing sensitive indicators’ has often been used without a theoretical or conceptual basis. What are the key findings? Holzemer's outcome model-guided matrix provides unique explanatory power for concept analysis. Attributes of nursing-sensitive indicators are revealed. This concept analysis shows the insufficient use and application of nursing process measures. How should the findings be used to influence policy/practice/research/education? The concept of nursing-sensitive indicators and its congruence with nursing theoretical models must be clearly articulated in research. Development of the concept of nursing-sensitive indicators remains a necessary step for the building of robust and distinctive nursing theories. The development of effective and sustainable information systems for clinical quality and safety governance that include nursing-sensitive indicators will benefit national approaches to enhance healthcare performance.

The development of effective and sustainable information systems for clinical quality and safety governance that include nursing-sensitive indicators will benefit national approaches to enhance healthcare performance. Introduction In this paper, nursing-sensitive indicators (NSIs) is the concept selected for analysis. In the past three decades, there has been great change and evolution in the concepts and theories that underpin nursing practice. This has been a time when ‘what nurses do’ needs to be quantified and measured to justify funding, and improve practice and patient outcomes – even though we know that practice is not generic and is most often subject to context. ‘Nursing sensitive indicators’ (NSIs) has been subject to considerable research development within the domain of the acute care setting where nurses have a degree of autonomy and control over processes of nursing care delivery (Naylor 2007, Aiken et al. 2009, Lake et al. 2010). The application of NSIs has developed from the vast and ongoing dialogues held between nursing executives, who manage nursing-related clinical performance and strategy initiatives in tertiary care facilities, and nursing academics who have an interest in the complex performance measurement and decision-making characteristics of contemporary healthcare organizations (Brown et al. 2010, Doran et al. 2011, Beck et al. 2013). Research to develop NSIs for use and application in the acute care domain must continue for several important reasons. First, NSIs have become an increasingly valid and reliable means to support nursing care quality and performance measurement in the hospital unit setting, including the evaluation of nursing clinical practice improvement (Brown et al. 2010, Patrician et al. 2010, Doran et al. 2011). Secondly, NSIs as variables have been increasingly drawn upon in primary research studies that empirically tested effects of nursing practice enhancement strategies on nursing-related outcomes (cf. Aiken et al. 2002, 2008, 2009, Needleman et al. 2007, 2011, Patrician et al. 2010, Blegen et al. 2011). Generally, those studies point to the complexity of, and variation within, the nursing practice environment of the acute care setting and the need for attention to related measures, models and theories. Thirdly, within the wider context of health system reform and heath policy development, considerable evidence advocates the building of NSI databases to support evidence-based healthcare practice (Aydin et","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis_1"}}],["935",{"pageContent":"and the need for attention to related measures, models and theories. Thirdly, within the wider context of health system reform and heath policy development, considerable evidence advocates the building of NSI databases to support evidence-based healthcare practice (Aydin et al. 2004, Kurtzman & Corrigan 2007). Background The use of the concept of NSIs remains problematic. There are considerable inconsistencies and irregularities of definitions of the concept (Burston et al. 2013). The concept has been applied in primary research without referring to a clearly linked nursing conceptual framework (cf. Lindberg & Ludvigsen 2012, Liu et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2013). Such a practice may threaten how the concept is studied and theoretically integrated for nursing knowledge development ,which, in turn, has bearing upon the meaningfulness and boundaries of the concept and relevance to clinical practice (Morse et al. 1996). Despite growing support for the use and application of the NSIs as metrics, their pattern of usage in primary research is not explicit. Moers et al. (2011) observed that nursing science had ‘…a fruitful decade of knowledge development from 1980 till 1990’; since then, theoretical discourse in nursing has been marginalized by an increase in empirical studies. We concur with Moers et al. (2011) and suggest that empirical studies and academic reviews related to the use of NSIs as metrics have received growing interest, whereas theoretical development of NSIs for application to the realm of acute care practice has advanced at a slower pace. This suggests that further study on the conceptual clarity of NSIs and their relationship with theory and practice is warranted. As concept analysis is known to enhance understanding of a concept's meaning (Baldwin 2008), it may help address the problem of ambiguity (Fawcett 2012). Hence, the aim of this study is to report a concept analysis of NSIs within the applied context of the acute care setting. This analysis involved integrating a modified method of concept analysis, as proposed by Walker and Avant (2005), with an organizing framework based on Holzemer's (1994) outcomes model for health care research. The steps adapted from Walker and Avant (2005) included identifying uses of the concept from literature, determining attributes, and describing surrogate terms, antecedents and consequences. Although Walker and Avant's method (200","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis_2"}}],["936",{"pageContent":"model for health care research. The steps adapted from Walker and Avant (2005) included identifying uses of the concept from literature, determining attributes, and describing surrogate terms, antecedents and consequences. Although Walker and Avant's method (2005) has been the most commonly used and is especially suitable for novice concept analysis due to its well-defined structured approach (Xyrichis & Ream 2008), Fawcett (2012) had suggested the need to commence concept analysis with a ‘frame of reference’. Given that Walker and Avant's method had been criticized for its lack of theoretical context (Paley 1996, Baldwin 2008), and that Penrod and Hupcey (2005) had argued that a concept's meaning should be examined within an existing theory, a conceptual matrix was incorporated to offset this deficit and to enhance the step ‘determining attributes’. Holzemer's model (1994) was chosen because it draws heavily upon Donabedian's Structure-Process-Outcome (SPO) model (1984) where foundations to the conceptual development of quality dimensions of nursing care performance have been studied using NSIs (cf. American Nurses Association 1995, 1996, Irvine et al. 1998, Doran & Sidani 2007, Dunton et al. 2007, Montalvo 2007, Clarke & Donaldson 2008, Loan et al. 2011). Known as Donabedian's model of quality care (1984), the SPO components are important to each other. As explained by Makary et al. (2006), “structure is how we organize care, process is what we do, and outcomes are what we achieve”. SPO components as measures of quality have been, to some extent, validated to guide understandings about interactions within the model (Kobayashi et al. 2011, Tvedt et al. 2012). More importantly, Holzemer's model (1994) provides an additional organizing framework to the SPO model by distinguishing patterns between patients, nursing and the healthcare setting. In this analysis, the purpose of introducing the matrix was to map ‘uses of the concept’ as a precursor to determine attributes.

Data sources Using ‘clinical indicators’ or ‘quality of nursing care’ as subject headings, and incorporating additional keywords ‘acute care’ and ‘nurs*’, literature searches were conducted in CINAHL and MEDLINE with full text within EBSCOhost databases. The keywords were incorporated to reflect the domain of the analysis and ensure the discipline focus of the study. As the term NSIs originated in 1996 (Maas & Delaney 2004), the searches were limited to English language journal articles published between 2000–2012 to reflect the development of NSIs history. The searches resulted in 179 journal articles. A hand search was conducted of the reference lists of these journal articles. After reviewing the abstracts of those articles, only primary research articles with a focus on using indicators in the acute care setting to measure quality dimensions of nursing care performance were selected. Primary research was selected because the use of the concept expressed as terms shows a level of maturity as the characteristics can be identified as indicators or variables. Journal articles that did not explicitly have this focus were excluded. To avoid repetitive information, we followed the method adopted by Baars et al. (2010). If multiple articles were written by the same author with a similar topic, only one article was included. Based on these criteria, the final sample of data sources for analysis comprised 38 journal articles. In this study, uses of the concept were operationalized as terms that denoted a nursing performance measurement that have an influence upon or are associated with an impact on quality. Results Definitions and surrogate terms In general, most authors who referred to NSIs (or related surrogate terms) in the selected data sources omitted a definition. Within selected data sources, Kunaviktikul et al. (2005) referred to the NSIs definition of the American Nurses Association (1996), which is noted as: ‘those indicators that capture care or its outcomes most affected by nursing care'. Albanese et al. (2010) provided two definitions, that of the American Nurses Association and the definition of the National Quality Forum (2004): “a nursing-sensitive performance measure as processes and outcomes – and structural proxies for these processes and outcomes (e.g. skill mix and nurse staffing hours) – that are affected, provided, and/or influenced by nursing personnel but for which nursing is not exclusively responsible”.

Patient-related structural terms were identified as ‘patient characteristic’. The term ‘patient characteristic’ generally refers to demographics such as the patients' gender, age and other variables such as duration of hospitalization, the type of ward, and the type of procedure undertaken. Nursing-related structural terms comprised Registered Nurses' (RNs) ‘education level’ and ‘years of experience’. Setting-related structural terms included ‘hours of nursing care per patient day’, ‘nurse staffing’, ‘patient acuity', patient turnover’, ‘workload intensity’, ‘percentage of hours supplied by RNs’, and ‘organizational factors of the nurse practice environment’ such as support for nursing education, nurse managers' ability related to leadership and support, relationships with other practitioners, and adequate facilities or budget for quality of care. Process terms Two subcategories were identified: nursing and setting. Nursing-related processes were denoted as ‘nursing intervention’ and/or ‘nursing practice’. A nursing intervention is described as any treatment based on a nurse's clinical judgment and knowledge that is applied to enhance patient outcomes (McCloskey & Bulechek 2000). A setting-related process term referred to ‘nursing documentation’ and ‘nursing care plan’. Outcome terms Three subcategories for outcome terms were identified.

Attributes Attributes of a concept are the characteristics most frequently associated with the concept, appear repeatedly in reference to it and are necessary for theory building (Walker & Avant 2005). As no standard has been widely accepted for defining empirically derived attributes, a provisional criterion is proposed in this paper in keeping with the atypical approaches to conduct a concept analysis. In this analysis, attributes were operationalized as the terms that were frequently cited. The measure of frequency was operationalized as use of a term ‘more than 10 times’. When this operation was applied, within the category ‘structural’, neither patient-related terms nor nursing-related terms had sufficient counts to meet the criterion, while ‘hours of nursing care per patient day’ (15) and ‘nurse staffing’ (14) remained in the setting-related subcategory. With regard to terms identified in the category ‘process’, none had sufficient counts. In the category ‘outcome’, only a limited number of patient-related terms reached the cut-off point. They included safety-related terms and included prevalence of ‘pressure ulcer’ (20), ‘falls and falls with injury’ (18), ‘nosocomial selective infection’ (11) and perception-related ‘patient/family satisfaction with nursing care’ (13).

Antecedents and consequences Antecedents are events or incidents that must occur prior to the occurrence of the concept, while consequences reflect the events that occur as a result of utilization of the concept in practice (Walker & Avant 2005). The genesis of the concept of NSIs has its basis in the historical features of organizational change in health care in the United States of America (USA). In response to the significant rise of healthcare expenses as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), a model of managed competition was introduced to form the basis of the Clinton administration's healthcare reform plan during the 1990s (Costello 1995, Baldor 1996). In reality, the implementation of the model in the competitive US healthcare environment became the driving force for the need to improve patient safety and contain costs. Outcome indicators, in general, were necessary to standardize measurements for internal and external comparisons. Hence, these organizational reconfigurations provided the impetus for the need to identify, develop and assess measures to support nursing practice enhancements and performance strategies. Indeed, it was in the US that the concept of NSIs was first coined in 1996 (Harrington 2009). The consequences of the concept of NSIs has meant that the development of NSIs as standardized nursing data elements remains a critical and expanding area of research. Without nursing standardized data elements, researchers must rely on proxy measures to establish associations between nursing practice and workplace enhancements and their effects on patient outcomes. As discussed by Kurtzman and Corrigan (2007, p. 25), consensus standards on data elements have additional benefits as they are: ‘…","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis_12"}}],["946",{"pageContent":"proxy measures to establish associations between nursing practice and workplace enhancements and their effects on patient outcomes. As discussed by Kurtzman and Corrigan (2007, p. 25), consensus standards on data elements have additional benefits as they are: ‘…intended for use by the public and other health care stakeholders to evaluate the extent to which and ways in which nurses in acute care hospitals contribute to patient safety, health care quality, and a professional work environment’. Development of the concept of NSIs has meant that significant steps in nursing research have supported associations, whether conclusive or not, between setting-related structural terms such as staffing and patient-related outcomes such as pressure ulcer. NSIs have been used to build robust nursing-sensitive databases that incorporate executive and clinical reporting information systems (Donaldson et al. 2005, Aydin et al. 2008). A consequence of the application and use of standardized NSIs is improved patient safety and workforce planning through enhanced knowledge that can specifically support decision-making (Aydin et al. 2004). In the USA, the development of the NSIs has incorporated the use of common nursing data definitions and collection methodologies that has enabled nursing data to be compared across units, hospital regions and states (Pazargadi et al. 2008, Brown et al. 2010). This has led to public reporting of quality indicators likely to inform consumers' hospitals choices, but also may assist busines-ses and insurers with their purchasing and reimbursement decisions. Discussion This analysis is positioned within quality dimensions of nursing care performance in the acute care setting where important relationships between the SPO model of Donabedian (1984) and other nursing models or frameworks are recognized (Needleman et al. 2007, Dubois et al. 2013). This Holzemer model-guided concept analysis has provided a synthesis of relevant primary research and has since revealed a helpful set of attributes. The defining attributes are not all-encompassing; rather this paper intends to offer a modest contribution to nursing science where the attributes determined are measurable, observable or verifiable components of the concept. Omission of process attributes While the literature shows that refinements to the use and application of standardized nursing process measures have been the subject of recent research based on the SPO model (Endacott et al. 2009, Jeffs et al. 2012), of note in the findings of this study was the omission of defining process attributes.

Needleman et al. (2007) described nursing process measures as obscure. Nursing process measures have been proven to be very difficult to manage in primary research. Reviews conducted by Burnes et al. (2007) and Savitz et al. (2010) found little evidence of research activity that measured the pairing of nursing process indicators and outcome indicators. Confinement to the structural domain Most of the attributes identified in this concept analysis were confined to the structural domain. One possible explanation may be that structural indicators are readily obtainable from hospital administrative databases, which support their frequent use as data sources. As shown in a systematic review by Pearson et al. (2006), the breadth of empirical studies has a tendency towards the use of structural nurse staffing indicators. Hearld et al. (2008) concurred that structural indicators appeared to be overused and in their review of 58 studies they found a preponderance (63%) of structure-outcome pairings. Needleman et al. (2007) also highlighted the need for refined research processes to verify structural and outcome associations as conclusions are not always consistent. For example, a Belgian study exploring the associations between nurse staffing and selected patient outcomes at the hospital level did not confirm North American findings that acute care hospitals with the most (or best trained) nursing staff have better patient outcomes than those with less (or worst trained) nursing staff (Van den Heede et al. 2008). Certainly, the evidence is conclusive that the collection of NSIs for translation in practice remains inherently appealing; nevertheless, there is a need for larger studies and cross-site comparisons to test associations using existing frameworks (Clarke & Aiken 2008, Aiken et al. 2009). Implications for nursing knowledge development and theory building Holzemer's (1994) matrix was used to structure and show a pattern of use of terms as a precursor to determine attributes; future research to inform quality dimensions of nursing care performance should continue to cement understandings of interactions across SPO components with designs that specify and connect conceptual, theoretical and empirical study components, so that theoretical knowledge development may advance at a faster pace.

As recommended by Doran et al. (2002) and Ausserhofer et al. (2013), nursing research based on the SPO framework must consider methodological approaches that ensure adequate control of potentially confounding variables. Implications for healthcare systems and nursing service improvement The concept of NSIs has far-reaching implications for informing national health policies and, in particular, policies related to an array of information system development associated with administrative activity, clinical activity, clinical management and business management including costing. It is known that data and information on performance are often tied, or inherently built into, administrative systems to support activity-based funding schemes where the data are used for hospital quality improvement initiatives (McNair et al. 2009, Duckett 2012). Yet nursing-sensitive hospital data remain, to some extent, invisible within information systems, even when policy efforts have been directed to link quality and payment (Kavanagh et al. 2012). The published literature concerning the safety and quality of health care attests that undesirable clinical behaviours persist without recourse to some sort of intervention (Doran et al. 2006, Van Herck et al. 2010, Nicholas et al. 2011). It has been established that meaningful quality monitoring information motivates health professionals to change practice and improve the quality and safety of clinical care if incentives are passed down to the service (Ryan 2009, Jha et al. 2012). Hence, the delivery of performance-based incentives directly to health professionals including nurses has received growing support on national quality and safety policy agendas (Eagar et al. 2012, Beck et al. 2013). Still, studies suggest that nurses, one of the largest groups of health professionals in acute care providing vital service at the bedside, are not particularly engaged with quality monitoring activities due to the lack of meaningful data reported to them at the service level (Burhans & Alligood 2010, Cline et al. 2011). To strengthen the use and application of relevant nursing data in information systems for improving quality dimensions of nursing care performance, a concerted effort is required to build mutual understanding on the language and phenomena of interest to its discipline and the refinement of conceptual terms including their attributes, properties and dimensions.

NSIs must be underpinned by efforts to develop common data standards and information system terminology, which are interoperable within national healthcare data systems. Attributes of NSIs have potential to interface and feature as performance measures within clinical quality information systems. Study limitations This concept analysis was limited to primary research data sources based upon a specified search strategy. Due to the evolving nature of the science on the topic of NSIs, the frequent use of surrogate terms and the limitations of database searching strategies, some relevant data sources may have been excluded. Nevertheless, all reference lists in selected articles were reviewed with an attempt to mitigate this limitation. Risjord's (2009) commentary on concept analysis has sought to strengthen its epistemological foundations as he argued that empirical justification should not be compromised. Risjord (2009) emphasizes that ‘gaps’ between ‘evidence and results’ are frequent in journal articles using concept analysis methodology, and that such gaps should be avoided to fulfil a complete understanding of the concept. With an attempt to minimize the limitations in previous concept analysis studies, as noted by Risjord (2009), this concept analysis was predominately based upon data sources from primary research. However, no specific evaluative criteria were applied when choosing the primary research articles; this may have affected the validity of this analysis. Commonly known traditional methods including those of Walker and Avant (2005) provide little direction on how empirically derived attributes can be justified (Penrod & Hupcey 2005, Risjord 2009). As there has been no concrete guidance available in the literature to support validation processes for the use and operationalization of empirical measurements to determine attributes in concept analysis, a cut-off point was introduced to establish a measure of frequency based on supporting empirical evidence. Given that only a small number of attributes were revealed by the use of the cut-off point, not only does this suggest that the concept of NSIs is immature but also implies that the cut-off point itself presents as a limitation.

These few structural and outcome attributes are offered as the most prevalent characteristics of the concept, given their frequent use in primary research. Conclusion This paper provides an analysis of the concept of NSIs where the need to develop a clear concept becomes ever more apparent on two key fronts: theory building for nursing science in acute care and informing the development of quality dimensions of healthcare information systems. A theory comprises concepts, definitions and propositions. A theory with clarified concepts ensures understanding of the theory itself, as well as the relationships among the concepts within the theory. Inroads have been made to progress understandings of the science of nursing quality and performance measurement (Needleman et al. 2007, Dubois et al. 2013). A key finding of this concept analysis is the attributes identified, which may be justified at least to some extent by the evidence used to support their determination. The insufficient use and application of nursing process measures is another key finding of this study; hence, a concerted effort must now ensue for their development, refinement and standardization. Donabedian (2005) considered the most direct approach to assess quality of care is an examination of the process of care itself. Doran et al. (2006) noted that nursing process measures are, in the main, poorly conceptualized as standard measurements. Doran (formerly known as Irvine) went on to use elements stemming from the SPO model to develop the Nursing Role Effectiveness Model (NREM) to support nursing-related quality improvement and clinical evaluation (Irvine et al. 1998). The NREM elaborates three distinct nursing role typologies in its process domain. It has been used to help understand and generate nursing process measures inherent to different nursing role requirements (Manojlovich 2005, Endacott et al. 2009, White et al. 2013). Other examples of clinical utilization of NREM include assessing the effectiveness of nursing interventions on patient outcomes in a general nursing setting (Morris et al. 2014); and gaining better understandings of how Registered Nurses' role components have an impact on specific activities and health outcomes (Rondinelli et","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Nursing-Sensitive Indicators - A Concept Analysis_17"}}],["951",{"pageContent":"the effectiveness of nursing interventions on patient outcomes in a general nursing setting (Morris et al. 2014); and gaining better understandings of how Registered Nurses' role components have an impact on specific activities and health outcomes (Rondinelli et al. 2014). The NREM may offer supplementary structure and depth to the ‘P’ domain, and is recommended for future modelling of nursing process measures. Nurses provide many services in acute care where NSIs have emerged as a substantive but partially immature concept. Often nursing services are neither properly understood by health service officials at many levels, nor appropriately communicated to them. Development of the concept of NSIs may illuminate the nature of nursing services and support nurses' engagement with quality monitoring and reporting. With ongoing support from primary research, further refinement of this concept may also enhance theoretical knowledge that supports connections between clinical processes and the development of health information systems.

Quality assessment initiatives are hindered by the paucity of available data related to nursing processes and patient outcomes across these three domains of practice. Direct care nurses are integral to self-regulation for the discipline as they are the best source of information about nursing practice and patient outcomes. Evidence supports the assumption that nurses do contribute to prevention of adverse events but there is insufficient evidence to explain how nurses contribute to these and/or other patient outcomes. The purposes of this article are to examine the imperatives, ideal conditions, history, and challenges related to effective outcome measurement in nursing. The article concludes with recommendations for action to move quality assessment forward, such as substantial investment to support adequate documentation of nursing practice and patient outcomes.

Few would engage in the demanding work of nursing without some degree of belief that their efforts make a difference. Nursing care is instrumental in achieving quality outcomes for patients, families, and communities. This assumption is foundational to the discipline of nursing and the social contract between nurses and the public. Few would engage in the demanding work of nursing without some degree of belief that their efforts make a difference. Likewise, nursing could not have emerged as the largest sector of the healthcare workforce unless employers and payors also assumed that nurses could make a valuable contribution to patient care. However, empirical evidence to support the unique contribution of nurses to quality outcomes is currently lacking (Needleman, Kurtzman, & Kizer, 2007). The discipline has long been criticized as a practice based more on tradition than evidence and this criticism has been met with multiple professional initiatives to stimulate evidence based practice and outcomes research. Measurement of nursing outcomes is a linchpin for both of these important and interrelated activities. assumptions about the nursing contribution to care must be replaced with empirical evidence of the nursing profession's actual contributions to care. The lack of evidence to delineate the nurse's contributions to care is problematic. In response to declining reimbursement and escalating quality and safety problems, stakeholders in the healthcare industry now challenge traditional assumptions across the delivery system and seek empirical evidence to guide system redesign. The goal of system redesign is encapsulated in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) six aims for care: safe, effective, timely, equitable, patient-centered, and efficient (IOM, 2001). Continued support is unlikely for care providers and processes that lack evidence of a meaningful contribution to these aims. Therefore, assumptions about the nursing contribution to care must be replaced with empirical evidence of the nursing profession's actual contributions to care. The purposes of this article are to examine the imperatives, ideals, history, and challenges related to effective outcome measurement in nursing and to identify recommendations for action.

The social imperative is described in the American Nurses Association (ANA) Social Policy Statement (ANA, 2010) and is codified in each nurse practice act. Nursing exists for the sole purpose of serving the public good; therefore, the public owns the discipline. Through the process of licensure, the public grants nurses the privilege to practice the art and science of nursing and in exchange, the public expects to receive quality care (ANA, 2010). Thus, the social contract between health professionals and the public dictates that nurses engage in self-regulation to assure quality performance. Assurance of performance requires measurement of performance (Donabedian, 2003). Moreover, the types of outcomes that nurses are duty-bound to measure and manage are inherent in the very definition of nursing, \"the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations\" (ANA, 2010, pp. 8). Therefore, nurses are accountable for and obligated to measure interventions and outcomes in the areas of health promotion, prevention of illness and injury, and alleviation of suffering. The economic imperative to measure and manage nursing outcomes is an extension of the social contract. Nurses are obligated to serve the public good through stewardship of health resources. Expending resources on nursing services with no clear benefit or failing to allocate resources for nursing services with a clear benefit is not good stewardship. Moreover, neither practice is consistent with the IOM (2001) aims for quality care. Therefore, nurses have a social obligation to develop and document the evidence base for the entirety of nursing practice and shift from a task-based practice, which emphasizes what nurses do for patients, to an outcome-based practice that emphasizes what nurses achieve with patients. External forces are now facilitating this shift toward an outcome-based practice for nursing and strengthening the imperative for outcome measurement. External forces are now facilitating this shift toward an outcome-based practice for nursing and strengthening the imperative for outcome measurement. In response to economic and quality concerns in healthcare, reimbursement policies have shifted from fee for service to value-based purchasing (VBP) (Bodrock & Mion, 2008; Kurtzman, Dawson, & Johnson, 2008).

Under the new VBP policies, provider reimbursement is tied to performance, defined as compliance with evidence-based practice guidelines and achievement of a growing list of desired patient outcome targets (Table 1). Consequently, organizations that fail to meet established performance targets incur penalties and lose revenue (Hines & Yu, 2009). The potential for lost revenue has many implications for nursing and patient care. As summarized in the business axiom, \"no margin, no mission,\" the mission of healthcare organizations is contingent upon a healthy profit margin. History demonstrates that when profit margins decrease, healthcare organizations invest fewer resources in services for patients and employees, to include nurses (Aiken, Clarke, & Sloane, 2001; Kavanagh, Comiotti, Abusalem, & Coty, 2012). This action translates into a downsized nursing workforce, fewer patient services, and decreased quality of care (Kurtzman et al., 2011; Timmers, Hulstaert, & Leenan, 2014). VBP policies are predicated on the idiom that what gets measured, gets managed. The outcomes addressed in current VBP policies primarily relate to the prevention of injury (e.g., nosocomial infection, pressure ulcers) and do not address other outcomes germane to the nursing profession's social contract (i.e., health promotion and the alleviation of suffering). This is problematic for patients and nurses. VBP policies are predicated on the idiom that what gets measured, gets managed. In other words, measurement of an outcome draws attention to that outcome and ultimately to its contributing factors. When performance on an outcome influences provider reimbursement, the increased attention is often accompanied by a reallocation of resources to correct the problem. Consequently, investment of resources in health promotion and alleviation of suffering is more likely to occur if related outcomes are measured and included in VBP policies. Therefore, nurses have a social and an economic responsibility to advocate for representation of these important patient outcomes in VBP policies, to document how nursing contributes to these outcomes, and to help organizations meet related targets.

Ideal Conditions & Challenges for Outcomes Measurement The act of measurement makes phenomena visible and functions to elevate actual and/or potential quality problems in the consciousness of stakeholders. There are no intrinsic benefits in measuring nursing outcomes; rather, the benefits are contingent upon whether or not the act of measurement results in changes that lead to improved quality of care (Farquhar, Kurtzman, & Thomas, 2010). The act of measurement makes phenomena visible and functions to elevate actual and/or potential quality problems in the consciousness of stakeholders. Regardless of intention, measure selection communicates importance and generates selective attention that ultimately drives selective improvement (Kurtzman & Jennings, 2008). Therefore, outcome measurement is best conceived as one interdependent component of the broader quality management enterprise with intentional selection of measures to drive improvement in outcomes relevant to nursing. The selection of quality measures sets is guided by conceptual models of quality, scientific standards, and the pragmatics of data collection. Conceptual Foundations of Quality Outcomes of care are generally regarded as the most important element of quality assessment The predominant conceptual model guiding quality management in healthcare was first described by Donabedian in 1966 and is known as the Structure-Process-Outcomes (SPO) model (Donabedian, 1966; Donabedian, 2003). Quality assessment is recognized as an essential aspect of quality management and three essential elements of quality assessment are identified: structures, processes, and outcomes of care (Figure). Outcomes of care are generally regarded as the most important element of quality assessment because they focus on patients and reflect the social mandate and ultimate goals of healthcare providers (i.e., changes in health status) (Donabedian, 2003). However, outcomes offer no guidance for quality improvement unless they are related to modifiable antecedents (e.g., structures and processes of care). Improving outcomes without knowledge of specific process failures is analogous to treating a disease of unknown etiology and can result in misdirected and/or delayed corrective action. Therefore, quality assessment is best achieved through a set of measures that include outcomes and associated structures and processes.

This means that effective quality assessment for the discipline of nursing is contingent upon a body of evidence that demonstrates relationships between the full complement of nursing interventions and the full scope of outcomes sensitive to nursing interventions. However, the very nature of nursing and health outcomes pose significant challenges in the application of these criteria for quality assessment in nursing. health outcomes are rarely, if ever, the result of a singular process or provider. The complex nature of healthcare is well documented (IOM, 2004). Patients typically receive care from teams of semiautonomous providers representing multiple disciplines and specialties working interdependently. Therefore, health outcomes are rarely, if ever, the result of a singular process or provider. For example, achievement of high functional status in a patient diagnosed with a cerebrovascular accident requires diagnostic and therapeutic interventions from physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and dieticians. Each discipline is necessary for recovery of function, yet none is sufficient. Thus, quantifying the unique contributions of each individual discipline is challenging. The combined dependent, independent, and interdependent components of nursing practice add to this challenge (Doran, 2011). Nurses not only diagnose and treat patient responses to health problems, they also carry out interventions prescribed by other disciplines. Additionally, nurses are primarily responsible for the coordination of care activities within and across healthcare teams. Therefore, there are few elements of care that do not pass through the hands of nurses, and few outcomes that are not influenced in some way by nursing care. In contrast to disciplines with highly technical interventions, many nursing interventions are more akin to the information transfer process of knowledge workers, and therefore more difficult to isolate and measure.

Nursing care is often more difficult to conceptualize and measure than care from other disciplines. In contrast to disciplines with highly technical interventions (e.g. surgical procedures), many nursing interventions are more akin to the information transfer process of knowledge workers, and therefore more difficult to isolate and measure (Matney, Maddox, & Staggers, 2014). For example, the nursing intervention of surveillance does not occur in a singular space or time. Rather, surveillance involves a series of interdependent activities to include the gathering of multiple pieces of information from multiple sources; analyzing the collected information for meaningful patterns; identifying the need for further intervention(s); and initiating appropriate action(s) (Fasolino & Verdin, 2015; Jones, 2011). Sometimes surveillance is initiated by one nurse and continued by other nurses throughout an episode of care. Therefore, surveillance cannot be conceived or measured as a discrete intervention (e.g. present or absent) completed by a single nurse. The intervention of surveillance also may require communication with other providers to initiate action that falls outside a nurse's independent scope of practice. Thus, in the instance of surveillance and other interdependent interventions, the ultimate outcome may be influenced as much by other providers as by nurses (Anthony, 2008; Jones, 2011; Kurtzman et al., 2011). Although nurses may contribute to a broad array of patient outcomes, the expected contribution is variable, and teasing out the unique nursing contribution to patient outcomes is difficult (Needleman et al., 2007). Not surprisingly, some nurses are unwilling to accept responsibility for outcomes over which they lack complete control. Not surprisingly, some nurses are unwilling to accept responsibility for outcomes over which they lack complete control. The Donabedian model is a useful organizing framework for quality assessment in healthcare, providing a generic overview of the essential categories of quality measures and supporting the necessity of empirically supported relationships within measure sets. However, this framework is not prescriptive and offers little guidance in the identification of specific quality measures. Instead, specific quality measures must be derived from domain and/or problem specific frameworks.

In contrast to frameworks based on the medical model of care (Donabedian, 2003), patient outcome categories proposed in nursing quality frameworks are typically more closely aligned with nursing's social mandate. Standards for Quality and Outcome Measurement Consensus standards for development of quality measures now exist and the National Quality Forum (NQF) is recognized as the as the common pathway for review and endorsement of quality measures in healthcare (Quraishi & Jordan, 2014). Federal law stipulates that policy makers defer to these standards when establishing healthcare policies such as VBP (Bodrock & Mion, 2008; Needleman et al., 2007). To be endorsed, quality measures must meet established standards in the following areas: importance, scientific acceptability, usability, and feasibility (NQF, 2004). These standards address issues related to the social mandate of nursing (importance), empirical evidence linking practice to outcomes (scientific acceptability and usability), and the pragmatics of data collection (feasibility). Outcomes that are not empirically linked to specific malleable processes are not useful because they do not help decision makers determine how to improve care. Quality measures are considered important to the extent that they address priority quality issues such as the IOM (2001) six aims and, in the case of nursing, the social mandate. Standards for scientific acceptability relate to the reliability and validity of measures and the strength of evidence linking measures to quality. Measures must be clearly defined and provide consistent and credible estimates of performance. The usability standard reflects the degree to which a measure is understandable to those making decisions that influence quality. To be useful, a measure must provide information that is actionable. Outcomes that are not empirically linked to specific malleable processes are not useful because they do not help decision makers determine how to improve care. Pragmatic Measurement Measures based on data collection methodologies intrinsic to care processes and captured by existing data systems are highly desirable.

In contrast, measures based on manual audits (e.g. chart abstraction, direct observation) and surveys have been considered less desirable. The standard of feasibility is most affected by issues associated with nursing documentation. Conceptually, the most valid source of data about nursing care and patient responses to nursing care is nursing documentation. However, the validity of nursing documentation as a data source is weakened by incomplete documentation. Lapses in nursing documentation hinder the ability to establish empirical links between nursing care and patient outcomes (Alexander, 2007; Anthony, 2008; Needleman et al., 2007). History of Outcomes Measurement in Nursing Nurse leaders and scholars have long recognized the need to measure the outcomes of nursing care and have attempted to address the associated challenges at various times throughout history. Following is a summary and critique of the pivotal outcome measurement activities in nursing from the 1970s to the present. The Minimum Data Set (MDS) Movement There was little emphasis on outcomes measurement in nursing until the 1970s and 1980s when payors, prompted by escalating healthcare costs, attempted systematic evaluations of the quality and cost of healthcare services. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supported the development of minimum data sets (MDS) to facilitate these evaluations (Hobbs, 2011). DHHS defined an MDS as the least amount of data needed to evaluate a specific service (Hobbs, 2011) and established the first MDS to evaluate hospital services in 1974: the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS). Due to the paucity of available clinical data at that time, the UHDDS was based on administrative data collected primarily for billing purposes. Nurse leaders were particularly concerned about the absence of information about nursing care in the UHDDS, fearing that this would result in the inability to cost out nursing services and establish the profession of nursing on equal footing with medicine in terms of contributions to inpatient care. Consequently,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges_8"}}],["961",{"pageContent":"concerned about the absence of information about nursing care in the UHDDS, fearing that this would result in the inability to cost out nursing services and establish the profession of nursing on equal footing with medicine in terms of contributions to inpatient care. Consequently, a core group of nurse leaders collaborated to develop an MDS specific to nursing (NMDS). An NMDS with 16 elements related to nursing care (nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions, nursing outcomes, and nursing intensity), and patient demographics, and service elements (facility, medical record number, nurse identifier, encounter dates, payor source, discharge disposition, and resource consumption) was submitted to DHHS in 1987 but was not endorsed (Hobbs, 2011; Klieb, Sales, Doran, Mallette, & White, 2011). The Outcomes Movement and the Nurse Report Card The 1990s marked the beginning of what has become known as the \"outcomes movement.\" The 1990s brought many activities related to the development and testing of nursing quality and outcome measures and marked the beginning of what has become known as the \"outcomes movement.\" The ANA led this activity in 1994 with the landmark Nurse Safety and Quality Initiative. This initiative emerged in response to concerns over the detrimental effects of declining hospital reimbursement on the quality of nursing care (Rowell, & Milholland, 1998). The purposes of this initiative were to: identify and evaluate potential nurse sensitive indicators; explore the theoretical and empirical relationships between the identified nursing structure, process, and outcome measures; and generate a nursing report card for acute care settings (Lewin-VHI, 1995). Consistent with the SPO framework, an initial measure set was identified and evaluated based on theoretical links to the quality of nursing care (Table 2). The evaluation process included a review of empirical evidence to support presumed linkages and an assessment of data quality and availability. None of the identified patient outcome measures were supported by a direct causal link to nursing structures or processes. Moreover, data were readily available for only two of the identified outcome measures (mortality and length of stay) and these measures had the weakest theoretical links to nursing care quality (Lewin-VHI, 1995). The identified outcomes were hospital-centric and did not reflect the full scope of outcomes included in the profession of nursing's social mandate or the full range of outcomes assumed to result from good nursing care.

The identified outcomes were hospital-centric and did not reflect the full scope of outcomes included in the profession of nursing's social mandate or the full range of outcomes assumed to result from good nursing care. Therefore, a comprehensive evidence-based report card to evaluate the quality of nursing care was not achieved. Instead, a sub-set of nurse structures and patient outcomes, primarily related to injury prevention, were selected for further development and inclusion in the first report card. The nurse structures were selected based on data availability and the outcomes were selected based on the strength of their theoretical link to nursing care quality. Notably, no nurse process measures were selected for further development and none were included in the first report card. This ANA initiative set the course for the next two decades of activities related to quality and outcomes assessment in nursing. Health services researchers intensified efforts to establish empirical relationships between available measures of nurse structures and patient outcomes related to injury prevention (e.g., adverse events) with minimal attention to nurse processes (Doran, 2011). As empirical evidence emerged and data collection efforts intensified, the number of proposed nurse-sensitive increased incrementally. Additionally, there was a proliferation of national and regional nurse-sensitive quality databases (Table 3) aiming to support quality assessment and demonstrate the nursing contribution patient care using measures similar to those proposed in the ANA initiative (Table 2). All of these databases were designed for the evaluation of nursing care in acute care hospitals, primarily on medical-surgical units. Nurse contribution to care in other practice settings received relatively little attention. Moreover, measure specifications and data collection procedures are not standardized (Alexander, 2007; Doran, 2011). By 2002, a total of 150 potential nurse sensitive measures were submitted to the NQF review process. However, only 15 of the proposed measures met the consensus standards for endorsement in 2004 (Table 4). Current Challenges Imperatives for nurses to engage in self-regulation through quality assessment and outcomes management are stronger than ever. Healthcare has entered a new age of accountability, accompanied by a low tolerance among stakeholders for poor quality and increasing costs (Farquhar, Kurtzman, & Thomas, 2010). Although some progress in the measurement and management of nursing outcomes is evident, major limitations persist. The profession still does not have a set of evidence-based measures that reflect the full scope of nursing services and the full continuum of outcomes sensitive to nursing care.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges_10"}}],["963",{"pageContent":"). Although some progress in the measurement and management of nursing outcomes is evident, major limitations persist. The profession still does not have a set of evidence-based measures that reflect the full scope of nursing services and the full continuum of outcomes sensitive to nursing care. Despite decades of intentional efforts to this end, the nurse contribution to patient outcomes has not been sufficiently quantified. Despite decades of intentional efforts to this end, nursing's contributions to patient outcomes have not been sufficiently quantified. There are still relatively few scientifically acceptable measures that can reliably capture nursing's contributions to patient care. Notably, nurse-sensitive indicators account for < 3% of the 500-plus measures endorsed by the NQF. Moreover, the NQF has not endorsed any additional nurse-sensitive structure, process, or outcome measures since 2004. State of the science reviews indicate that the challenges of effective quality and outcomes measurement in nursing have changed very little in the past 40 plus years (Alexander, 2007; Griffiths, 1995; Naylor, 2007; Needleman et al., 2007). Insufficient Evidence Base The evidence base linking nurse structures with patient outcomes related to adverse events is much more robust than at the time of the ANA report card initiative (Brennan, Daly, & Jones, 2013; Kane, Shamliyan, Mueller, Duval, & Wilt, 2007; Krueger, Funk, Green, & Kuznar, 2013; Lankshear, Sheldon, & Maynard, 2005). However, the effect of staffing and nursing education on patient outcomes, though statistically significant, is relatively small by scientific and clinical standards. Moreover, due to limitations of study designs, the body of evidence produced thus far is still insufficient to support direct causal paths linking nurse structures to patient outcomes. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to explain how nurses contribute to outcomes. Consequently, few evidence based changes in practice have materialized. Insufficient Process Measures the active ingredients of nursing care must be identified and quantified. A key contributing factor in the failure to establish direct causal linkages between nursing care and patient outcomes is the lack of available nursing process measures. Presumably, nurse structures influence patient outcomes through nursing care processes. Researchers cannot establish specific causal chains without capturing the effects of nurse structures on nurse processes and/or the effects of nurse processes on patient outcomes (Needleman et al., 2007).

In other words, the active ingredients of nursing care must be identified and quantified. Nurse process measures were not represented in the original nurse report card and remain underrepresented in each database that followed (Table 3). The only nurse process measure endorsed by the NQF relates to smoking cessation counseling for selected hospitalized patient populations. This process measure by no means captures the full scope of nursing practice in any practice setting and is not likely to make a significant contribution to the limited number of patient outcomes endorsed by NQF and included in available nurse databases. No Standardized Nursing Taxonomy Efforts to promote a NMDS have continued since the 1980s along with parallel activities to promote a universally accepted taxonomy for nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes (Daly, Maas, & Johnson, 1997; Halloran & Halloran, 2015; Needleman et al., 2007). However, neither has been widely adopted in the United States. Execution of a NMDS requires a standardized language to effectively capture nursing services and outcomes of interest (Mac Neela, Scott, Treacy, & Hyde, 2006). Although universally accepted taxonomies for diseases (i.e., the international clinical disease classification) and medical intervention (i.e., clinical procedure codes) were fully integrated into practice settings in the 1980s (Outland, Newman, & Williams, 2015), corollary taxonomies for nursing were not fully developed. Recent evidence also suggests that bedside nurses are still reluctant to adopt a standardized nursing taxonomy (Halloran & Halloran, 2015; Schwiran & Thede, 2011). Quality Assessment and Documentation Burden Though highly relevant to quality assessment and self-regulation in nursing, development and routine monitoring of nurse process measures has fallen into the \"too hard to do\" domain. The development of robust nurse process measures is hindered by issues related to incomplete and unstandardized documentation, documentation burden, and data collection burden.

Though highly relevant to quality assessment and self-regulation in nursing, development and routine monitoring of nurse process measures has fallen into the \"too hard to do\" domain. However, technological advances and healthcare reform legislation provide new opportunities to address some of these challenges. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided incentives for healthcare organizations to invest in electronic health records (McCulloch & Tegethoff, 2013). This legislation authorized incentive payments to providers related to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) and meaningful use of data from them. Meaningful use includes the reuse of clinical and administrative data to improve the safety, quality, and access to care for patients (Westra et al., 2010). In 2015, incentive payments related to compliance with meaningful use standards were replaced with penalties for noncompliance. Consequently, adoption of EHRs has increased over time (Abbass, Helton, Mhatre, & Sansgiry, 2012). Many believed that this technology would result in significant cost savings through efficiencies gained in documentation and retrieval of clinical information (Jones & Kessler, 2010). Introduction of EHRs has indeed changed nursing documentation processes and retrieval of information for analyses. However, the adoption of EHRs has not yet achieved the expected benefits. For example, in one hospital with an electronic nursing documentation system, compliance with documentation of selected interventions to prevent hospital acquired complications was as low as 16% (Cutugno, Hozak, Fitzsimmons, & Ertogan, 2015). Electronic prompts and forcing functions can be added to reduce lapses in documentation. Electronic documentation systems have not reduced the documentation burden for nurses. While these tools may result in more complete documentation, they also may increase documentation burden (Cutugno et al., 2015). The current documentation burden in nursing is high and is a major source of job dissatisfaction among direct care nurses (Hakes & Whittington, 2008). Responses to the documentation burden include extending work hours to complete documentation, diverting time away from patient care to complete documentation, or leaving documentation incomplete. Electronic documentation systems have not reduced the documentation burden for nurses.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Outcomes Measurement in Nursing - Imperatives, Ideals, History, and Challenges_13"}}],["966",{"pageContent":"& Whittington, 2008). Responses to the documentation burden include extending work hours to complete documentation, diverting time away from patient care to complete documentation, or leaving documentation incomplete. Electronic documentation systems have not reduced the documentation burden for nurses. Evidence suggests that time spent on documentation increases immediately after implementation but eventually returns to baseline (Hakes & Whittington, 2008; Munyisia, Yu, & Hailey, 2011). Payment incentives for adoption of EHRs stipulate that recipients demonstrate how they are using data from the EHR to improve quality. Therefore, documentation screens are often built around endorsed quality measures, particularly those associated with VBP. Compared to abstraction of data from paper based documentation systems, retrieval of data from an EHR for quality analysis and reporting is more efficient (Alexander, 2007). This gain in efficiency is further enhanced when data fields are standardized across facilities and populated with a standardized taxonomy; therefore, adoption of EHRs may increase adoption of a NMDS. However, standardization has yet to be achieved and few systems are built to accommodate available nursing taxonomies (Alexander, 2007; Needleman et al., 2007). EHR technology can accommodate an almost infinite number of data fields and this may increase the opportunity to develop more nurse process measures. However, time must be expended to populate every data field created. Therefore, every additional data field potentially adds to the documentation burden for nurses. The efficiency gained in information retrieval is potentially offset by a loss of efficiency related to data entry. Evidence suggests that direct care nurses are skeptical about whether or not expanded VBP policies will ultimately improve quality and safety for patients, but they are confident that an expansion of quality targets will increase their documentation burden (Kurtzman et al., 2011). Moreover, there is some concern that this burden will result in a shift of attention away from patient care, essentially putting the assessment of quality in competition with the performance of quality. Limited Scope and Participation in Nursing Databases Despite the proliferation of national and regional nursing databases, participation is voluntary and no available databases contain information on all of the 15 nurse-sensitive measures endorsed by the NQF (Kurtzman, Dawson, & Johnson, 2008; Kurtzman & Jennnings, 2008; VanFosson, Jones, & Yoder, 2015).

Efforts to develop nurse-sensitive indicators for other practice settings, such as oncology (Fessele, Yendro, & Mallory, 2014), ambulatory care (Martinez, Battaglis, Start, Mastal, & Matlock, 2015), schools (Forward, 2012), public health (Bigbee & Issel, 2012), and women's health (Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses [AWHONN], 2014) are underway; however, comparable performance databases for these practice settings do not currently exist. Consequently, the contribution of nursing care to patient outcomes is still not evaluated in many practice settings. Limited Range of Patient Outcome Measures The limited range of endorsed patient outcomes is problematic. Despite the evolution of comprehensive nurse specific conceptual frameworks that promote outcomes related to the role of nurses in health promotion (e.g. health promoting behaviors, self-care) and alleviation of suffering (e.g. symptom management), these types of outcomes remain underdeveloped and ignored. Similar to outcomes included in the VBP initiative (Table 1) and the first nurse report card (Table 2), the nurse-sensitive patient outcomes endorsed by the NQF (Table 4) exclusively reflect the nurse role in the prevention of a limited number of adverse events. The consequences of this are both intentional and unintentional. Patient outcomes reflected in the endorsed measures are important and the act of measurement has without question generated selective attention and resource allocation toward reducing complications. However, this may be accompanied by the diversion of attention and resources away from other, perhaps equally important, patient needs. For example, evidence from multiple studies of unfinished nursing care indicate that direct care nurses prioritize care based more on what gets measured/audited than on individualized patient needs (Jones, Hamilton, & Murry, 2015). This is the educational equivalent of \"teaching to the test\" and is a form of metric-driven harm. The type of metric driven harm known as tunnel vision is defined as the prioritization of financially incentivized and/or measured care over other valuable aspects of care (Bodrock & Mion, 2008; Rambur, Vallett, Cohen, & Tarule, 2013).

While adverse events are important, the question remains as to whether or not they should receive a disproportionate share of nursing attention and organizational resources compared to other quality problems. Recommendations for Action More emphasis is needed on establishing clinically meaningful relationships between specific nurse process measures and patient outcomes that reflect the full spectrum included in the nursing profession's social mandate. Challenges to self-regulation and quality assessment in nursing are complex and systemic, and the responsibility for these functions is the joint responsibility of nurse scientists, nurse providers, nurse administrators, and nurse academicians. Sustained innovative and collaborative actions from multiple stakeholders are needed. Development of evidence-based, nurse-sensitive quality measures that meet the NQF consensus standards must become a research priority. The focus of research must expand beyond measures of nurse structures, such as staffing and nurse education. More emphasis is needed on establishing clinically meaningful relationships between specific nurse process measures and patient outcomes that reflect the full spectrum included in the nursing profession's social mandate. The development of nurse-sensitive process and outcome measures must be guided by the NQF consensus standards to make the endorsement process more expedient. This shift will require changes in academic programs and research funding policies. More academic programs are needed that equip graduates to develop and evaluate nurse-sensitive indicators. This type of research falls under the umbrella of health services and/or nursing administration research which is notoriously underfunded compared to biobehavioral research (Edwardson, 2006; Holubowich & Andos, 2008; Murphy, Scott, & Warshawsky, 2014). Consequently, many colleges and universities have not developed active research programs in this area. A strategic approach to resource allocation and priority setting among major funding agencies, such as the National Institute for Nursing Research (NINR) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), is needed to incentivize investments in outcomes research by academic organizations. Nursing interventions are absent in most administrative databases and represented patient outcomes are limited to adverse events. Researchers must be willing to pursue methods beyond secondary analysis of these databases. Existing nursing outcomes databases (see Table 3) are similarly limited. More robust clinical databases are needed. Primary data collection and manipulation of non-standardized data are time and resource intensive.

Primary data collection and manipulation of non-standardized data are time and resource intensive. Moreover, healthcare organizations are often hesitant to share clinical and operational data with non-employees, even for research purposes. Therefore, access to better data also will require significant investments by healthcare organizations in clinical documentation systems and more collaborative partnerships with researchers. It is imperative that nurse administrators proactively drive the design of performance monitoring systems that address the needs of the discipline of nursing. Specific actions are needed by nurse leaders and administrators in the areas of measure selection, adoption of technology, and resource allocation. Performance measures must be selected with thoughtful intention. Although the nursing quality agenda should accommodate measures related to efficiency, accreditation requirements, and VBP, it should be driven by the social contract. It is imperative that nurse administrators proactively drive the design of performance monitoring systems that address the needs of the discipline of nursing. Specifically, vendors, nurse informaticians, and quality specialists should be directed to design systems that provide reliable and valid information about nursing interventions and patient outcomes related to the following areas: self-care, health promoting behaviors, functional status, symptom management, knowledge of disease and treatment, and health-related quality of life. Once developed, researchers must be given access to these systems for the kind of robust research needed to develop nurse-sensitive measures that satisfy NQF consensus standards. Quality assessment and self-regulation cannot move forward without substantial investments to support adequate documentation of nursing practice and patient outcomes. Quality assessment and self-regulation cannot move forward without substantial investments to support adequate documentation of nursing practice and patient outcomes. Direct care nurses are key sources of information in these areas; however, challenges related to documentation burden persist. It is time to garner the will and the resources to support direct care nurses as they struggle to document all aspects of their care, to include patient responses. Keyboard entry of data into the EHR continues to be as burdensome as handwritten documentation. At the very least, nurse administrators must request and support ongoing testing of user interface screens to maximize efficiency (Hyun, Johnson, Stetson, & Bakken, 2009). Refinement of the user interface alone will not likely be sufficient. Nurse administrators must lead the development and application of new technologies to increase the efficiency of nurse documentation.

Nurse administrators must lead the development and application of new technologies to increase the efficiency of nurse documentation. Voice recognition technology for direct documentation has been used in other disciplines (Dela Cruz et al., 2014; McCartney, 2013) but has not been adequately evaluated in nursing. Phase I trials with nurses demonstrated promising results (Fratzke et al., 2014) but additional refinements are needed to enhance feasibility. Nurse administrators should initiate partnerships with vendors to guide these refinements and provide opportunities for beta testing. Nurse administrators also should consider allocation of additional human resources to address the documentation burden. Staffing levels that result in documentation lapses are unsatisfactory and it is unlikely that technology alone will solve the problem. Although an increase in nurse staffing is associated with an increase in cost, that cost must be weighed against the costs associated with incomplete documentation, nurse overtime, and nurse dissatisfaction. One alternative strategy used by physicians to address documentation burden is to hire scribes to shadow clinicians and document clinical activities and observations (Hertz, 2014). Nurse administrators should explore the feasibility of off-loading keyboard data entry to other, less costly members of the care team. Conclusion Instead of continuing to search for relevance in available data, efforts must shift to making the collection of relevant data more feasible. Nurses have a social responsibility to evaluate the effect of nursing practice on patient outcomes in the areas of health promotion, injury and illness prevention, and alleviation of suffering. Quality assessment and outcomes research initiatives have historically been hindered by lack of available data related to nursing processes and patient outcomes across these domains of practice. Failure to invest in data collection methodologies that yield reliable and valid measures of important nursing care processes and patient outcomes has resulted in an inadequate evidence base to support the nurse contribution to patient care. New strategies to address the challenges of effective quality assessment and outcome measurement in nursing must be implemented. Instead of continuing to search for relevance in available data, efforts must shift to making the collection of relevant data more feasible. Table 1.

We hope the companion resource, Pathways to Population Health: An Invitation to Health Care Change Agents (the Framework) has helped your organization chart a potential path forward for your work. The Pathways to Population Health Compass (the Compass) is intended to help your organization catalogue existing improvement efforts, as well as identify new opportunities to make practical, meaningful, and sustainable advances in population health. This resource is ideally suited for individuals or teams with the agency to advance population health improvement efforts within their organization. The Compass takes approximately 20 minutes to complete and you are encouraged to review and update your responses quarterly to track progress over time. Pathways to Population Health: Four Portfolios of Population Health www.ihi.org/p2ph 4 Instructions for Using the Compass The Compass includes a series of statements to identify the current state of your organization’s activities to advance different components of the Pathways to Population Health Framework: • Stewardship • Equity • Payment • Partnerships with People with Lived Experience • Portfolio 1: Physical and/or Mental Health (Data, Team-Based Care, Behavioral Health Integration, Care Management) • Portfolio 2: Social and/or Spiritual Well-Being (Data, Social Determinant Screening/Referrals) • Portfolio 3: Community Health and Well-Being (Data, Community Partnerships, Community Benefit) • Portfolio 4: Communities of Solutions (Data, Leveraging Nontraditional Roles, Policy) As you consider your organization’s journey toward improving population health, please select the description that best represents the attitudes, behaviors, or actions currently underway. The responses represent examples of the types of activities an organization may be undertaking. The purpose of completing the Compass is to provide a snapshot of your organization’s current activities and suggest some possible next steps to help your organization progress to where it wants to be. Please select one response per statement. The numerical value associated with each response contributes to a “score” to assess current activities for each component, and to help your organization evaluate the balance of activities across portfolios. Circle your answers within the tool and mark the associated numbers in the scoring sheet on the last page. The scoring sheet (page 10) will walk you through how to calculate your scores, which range from 0-100, and interpret your results (page 11). www.ihi.org/p2ph 5 Pathways to Population Health Compass Stewardship As you consider the perspective of your organization’s","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Pathways to Population Health - Pathways to Population Health Compass.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Pathways to Population Health - Pathways to Population Health Compass","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Pathways to Population Health - Pathways to Population Health Compass_1"}}],["986",{"pageContent":"how to calculate your scores, which range from 0-100, and interpret your results (page 11). www.ihi.org/p2ph 5 Pathways to Population Health Compass Stewardship As you consider the perspective of your organization’s leaders as it relates to population health, please select the description that best represents the attitudes, behaviors, or actions currently underway.

Cipriano, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN I n 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, otherwise known as Obamacare) created a blueprint for a potential sea change that’s not well understood by many Americans. The ACA’s most visible impacts are the more than 20 million people now covered with health insurance and the shifting of payments to reward quality rather than quantity of care. What may be less apparent are the imperatives to improve the health of all people and reduce disease burden, embodied in the 2011 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) National Quality Strategy.1 Mandated in the ACA, the strategy embraces the goals of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Triple Aim: better experience of care that’s accessible, reliable, and safer; healthier people and communities, which addresses the behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of health; and more affordable care through lower costs. Achieving better health of populations The Quality Strategy aims are interdependent and rely on a set of six priorities. (See Table 1.) Nurses are very familiar with the priorities that focus on safer care delivery without harm, patient and family engagement in care, and effective communication and increased care coordination. It’s time we turn more attention to attacking the leading causes of mortality, enabling healthy living in our communities and creating new delivery models for more affordable, accessible, and equitable care. These actions lead to healthier populations. The first formal definition proposed for population health was “the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.”2 Early conceptualizations addressed general health outcomes and were applied to specified geographic regions. Increased attention on the Triple Aim and the National Quality Strategy has prompted widespread use of the term, which now calls for greater clarity in understanding what population health means in clinical settings. The original Triple Aim pronouncement suggested that a population need not only be thought of in geographic terms, but alternatively as a group of people with a common concern or condition. This allows us to learn about the care experience, health status, and costs of care.3 With growing emphasis on ensuring value in care, use of the term population health management has become a common way that health systems describe active approaches to addressing specific patient populations.

The outcomes of population health management contribute to total population health, which has long been the purview of public health and community officials, as well as business leaders concerned about the economic impact of health. Experts who’ve studied approaches to defining and measuring population health among public and private providers, as well as stakeholders, strongly recommend the use of “total population health” when addressing goals and objectives for improving overall health status and outcomes.4 Population health management: A formula for value Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Nursing Informatics www.nursingmanagement.com Nursing Management • February 2017 23 Central to improving total population health is recognizing the social, economic, and physical conditions that affect our health. Commonly referred to as the social and behavioral determinants of health, these cover a broad range of conditions, such as education; safety; literacy; access to healthcare; resources to meet daily needs, such as food and housing; a protective physical environment free from barriers and hazards; and health-promoting behaviors and resilience. The saying “the zip code where you live may determine how long you live” is a sad and alarming commentary on the effects of poverty, violence, lack of resources or access to healthy foods, and the absence of clean air and water, which threaten many poor people across our nation. It follows that achieving better patient outcomes across a population requires integration of the social determinants of health, management of chronic conditions, and effective clinician communication. Nurses are well aware of the effects of these social determinants and are uniquely positioned to deliver services to address these needs. Neither population health management nor total population health operates in isolation. Early public health nurses embraced Florence Nightingale’s vision of a public health system predicated on health promotion and disease prevention. Greater collaboration of healthcare system organizations and public health is needed today to connect the dots across the continuum of experiences from health and wellness to illness and recovery. Hospitals, public health departments, and community leaders can better influence a population’s health outcomes when working together.5 Toward a value-based payment system Healthcare providers, organizations, and payers used to focus on an individual, an episode of care, and garnering maximum allowable payment for services.

The reimbursement system rewarded more care that may not always have been necessary or optimal for a particular patient. Since passage of the ACA, HHS has introduced several approaches to move reimbursement from feefor-service to value-based payments, shifting the onus of risk in part to providers who must take more responsibility for better health outcomes. This paradigm shift, affecting virtually all providers and organizations, assesses both cost and quality in determining the value of care—a sweet spot for nursing. RNs are the drivers of significant improvements in hospital care and outcomes, as demonstrated in recent reports revealing a 17% decline in hospitalacquired conditions (HACs) between 2010 and 2013. In total, this resulted in 2.1 million fewer HACs, 87,000 saved lives, and $20 billion in savings.6 As we commit to providing value in healthcare, we need to describe and measure it through the patient lens. Value depends on the achieved results and evaluates condition-specific outcomes relative to the costs incurred. Measuring value incorporates all of the services and assistance that help meet a patient’s needs for a particular condition, with shared accountability across providers and organizations for total care and any complications. This includes primary and preventive care, as well as disease-focused care that’s episodic or chronic.7 When it comes to measuring quality, we’re data rich and information poor. We collect data on many quality measures, record patient data from both providers and patients, and attempt to aggregate data from multiple sites and services. However, measurement of value may be elusive depending on the type of data we have and few process measures describe outcomes. Frequently, we use only easily retrievable administrative data, such as billed services; these don’t convey the patient’s experience or outcomes. We often lack patientspecific quality data and may be limited with data that reflect only a slice of care, rather than a full cycle over a course of treatment.

Tracking of electronic health data is also needed to identify gaps in care and inform information-driven care plans that are longitudinal in nature. It’s time for nurses to step up and lead the move to population health management. Nurses know the power of data to paint the picture of a patient’s or population’s health status. Nurses are already in key roles coordinating care, managing complex populations and chronic diseases with high illness burden, and keeping track of outcomes. The movement to population health management to produce total population health is tailor-made to fully utilize the expertise and talent of nurses across many settings. To support these roles, we need robust information systems and a commitment to utilize cutting edge tools that not only track patient data, but also provide syndromic surveillance to uncover trends that contribute to health risks or changing conditions. Systems must also do more than quantify transactions; they must capture and reflect total care and patient experience, as well as outcomes. Our health information technology (IT) systems need to work for clinicians and patients. Consider these tips to leverage the power of health IT: • ensure that systems allow for collection of social and behavioral determinants of health • promote work within your organization to address community needs, including your own employees, resulting from social and behavioral determinants of health • press for analytics that deliver information to nurses not only in care management roles, but also those organizing and managing delivery services","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Population health management - A formula for value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Population health management - A formula for value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Population health management - A formula for value_3"}}],["1004",{"pageContent":"health • promote work within your organization to address community needs, including your own employees, resulting from social and behavioral determinants of health • press for analytics that deliver information to nurses not only in care management roles, but also those organizing and managing delivery services • utilize information to tailor interventions to enhance care for specific populations, including those with chronic diseases and for those whom prevention is key to promoting health • embrace patient reported data, making sure it’s visualized and acted upon • understand and advocate for health information exchange and interoperability to have more complete access to patient histories and care summaries from multiple providers • work with data analytics professionals to uncover and address trends revealed in a specific population or geographic area that may be affecting a variety of groups in your service areas • use data to coach patients to identify their health risks, reach their goals, and achieve greater value in care.

Winters-Miner, PhD - October 6, 2014 14 mins Image from Practical Predictive Analytics and Decisioning Systems for Medicine (Elsevier 2014) Everyone is a patient at some time or another, and we all want good medical care. We assume that doctors are all medical experts and that there is good research behind all their decisions. But that can't always be the case. Physicians are smart, well trained and do their best to stay up to date with the latest research. But they can't possibly commit to memory all the knowledge they need for every situation, and they probably don't have it all at their fingertips. Even if they did have access to the massive amounts of data needed to compare treatment outcomes for all the diseases they encounter, they would still need time and expertise to analyze that information and integrate it with the patient's own medical profile. But this kind of in-depth research and statistical analysis is beyond the scope of a physician's work. That's why more and more physicians – as well as insurance companies – are using predictive analytics. Predictive analytics (PA) uses technology and statistical methods to search through massive amounts of information, analyzing it to predict outcomes for individual patients. That information can include data from past treatment outcomes as well as the latest medical research published in peer-reviewed journals and databases. Not only can PA help with predictions, but it can also reveal surprising associations in data that our human brains would never suspect. In medicine, predictions can range from responses to medications to hospital readmission rates. Examples are predicting infections from methods of suturing, determining the likelihood of disease, helping a physician with a diagnosis, and even predicting future wellness. The statistical methods are called learning models because they can grow in precision with additional cases. There are two major ways in which PA differs from traditional statistics (and from evidence-based medicine): First, predictions are made for individuals and not for groups Second PA does not rely upon a normal (bell-shaped) curve. Prediction modelling uses techniques such as artificial intelligence to create a prediction profile (algorithm) from past individuals. The model is then 'deployed\" so that a new individual can get a prediction instantly for whatever the need is, whether a bank loan or an accurate diagnosis.

In this post, I discuss the top seven benefits of PA to medicine – or at least how they will be beneficial once PA techniques are known and widely used. In the United States, many physicians are just beginning to hear about predictive analytics and are realizing that they have to make changes as the government regulations and demands have changed. For example, under the Affordable Care Act, one of the first mandates within Meaningful Use demands that patients not be readmitted before 30 days of being dismissed from the hospital. Hospitals will need predictive models to accurately assess when a patient can safely be released. 1. Predictive analytics increase the accuracy of diagnoses. Physicians can use predictive algorithms to help them make more accurate diagnoses. For example, when patients come to the ER with chest pain, it is often difficult to know whether the patient should be hospitalized. If the doctors were able to answers questions about the patient and his condition into a system with a tested and accurate predictive algorithm that would assess the likelihood that the patient could be sent home safely, then their own clinical judgments would be aided. The prediction would not replace their judgments but rather would assist. In a visit to one's primary care physician, the following might occur: The doctor has been following the patient for many years. The patient's genome includes a gene marker for early onset Alzheimer's disease, determined by researchers using predictive analytics. This gene is rare and runs in the patient's family on one side. Several years ago, when it was first discovered, the patient agreed to have his blood taken to see if he had the gene. He did. There was no gene treatment available, but evidence based research indicated to the PCP conditions that may be helpful for many early Alzheimer's patients. Ever since, the physician has had the patient engaging in exercise, good nutrition, and brain games apps that the patient downloaded on his smart phone and which automatically upload to the patient's portal. Memory tests are given on a regular basis and are entered into the electronic medical record (EMR), which also links to the patient portal. The patient himself adds data weekly onto his patient portal to keep track of time and kinds of exercises, what he is eating, how he has slept, and any other variable that his doctor wishes to keep track of. Because the PCP has a number of Alzheimer's patients, the PCP has initiated an","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Seven Ways Predictive Analytics Can Improve Healthcare.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Seven Ways Predictive Analytics Can Improve Healthcare","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Seven Ways Predictive Analytics Can Improve Healthcare_1"}}],["1008",{"pageContent":"keep track of time and kinds of exercises, what he is eating, how he has slept, and any other variable that his doctor wishes to keep track of. Because the PCP has a number of Alzheimer's patients, the PCP has initiated an ongoing predictive study with the hope of developing a predictive model for individual likelihood of memory maintenance and uses, with permission, the data thus entered through the patients' portals. At this visit, the physician shares the good news that a gene therapy been discovered for the patient's specific gene and recommends that the patient receive such therapy. 2. Predictive analytics will help preventive medicine and public health. With early intervention, many diseases can be prevented or ameliorated. Predictive analytics, particularly within the realm of genomics, will allow primary care physicians to identify at-risk patients within their practice. With that knowledge, patients can make lifestyle changes to avoid risks (An interview with Dr. Tim Armstrong on this WHO podcast explores the question: Do lifestyle changes improve health?) As lifestyles change, population disease patterns may dramatically change with resulting savings in medical costs. As Dr. Daniel Kraft, Medicine and Neuroscience Chair at Stanford University, points out in his video Medicine 2064: During the history of medicine, we have not been involved in healthcare; no, we've been consumed by sick care. We wait until someone is sick and then try to treat that person. Instead, we need to learn how to avoid illness and learn what will make us healthy. Genomics will play a huge part in the shift toward well-living. As Dr. Kraft mentions, our future medications might be designed just for us because predictive analytics methods will be able to sort out what works for people with \"similar subtypes and molecular pathways.\" 3. Predictive analytics provides physicians with answers they are seeking for individual patients. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a step in the right direction and provides more help than simple hunches for physicians. However, what works best for the middle of a normal distribution of people may not work best for an individual patient seeking treatment. PA can help doctors decide the exact treatments for those individuals. It is wasteful and potentially dangerous to give treatments that are not needed or that won't work specifically for an individual. (This topic is covered in a paper by the Personalized Medicine Coalition.) Better diagnoses and more targeted treatments will naturally lead to increases in good outcomes and fewer resources used, including the doctor's time. 4.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Seven Ways Predictive Analytics Can Improve Healthcare.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Seven Ways Predictive Analytics Can Improve Healthcare","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Seven Ways Predictive Analytics Can Improve Healthcare_2"}}],["1009",{"pageContent":"'t work specifically for an individual.

Better diagnoses and more targeted treatments will naturally lead to increases in good outcomes and fewer resources used, including the doctor's time. 4. Predictive analytics can provide employers and hospitals with predictions concerning insurance product costs. Employers providing healthcare benefits for employees can input characteristics of their workforce into a predictive analytic algorithm to obtain predictions of future medical costs. Predictions can be based upon the company's own data or the company may work with insurance providers who also have their own databases in order to generate the prediction algorithms. Companies and hospitals, working with insurance providers, can synchronize databases and actuarial tables to build models and subsequent health plans. Employers might also use predictive analytics to determine which providers may give them the most effective products for their particular needs. Built into the models would be the specific business characteristics. For example, if it is discovered that the average employee visits a primary care physician six times a year, those metrics can be included in the model. Hospitals will also work with insurance providers as they seek to increase optimum outcomes and quality assurance for accreditation. In tailoring treatments that produce better outcomes, accreditation standards are both documented and increasingly met. (Likewise, predictive analytics can support the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model in that the primary goal of ACO is the reduction of costs by treating specific patient populations successfully. Supply chain management (SCM) for model hospitals and insurance providers will change as needs for resources change; in fact when using PA, those organizations may see otherwise hidden opportunities for savings and increasing efficiency. PA has a way of bringing our attention to that which may not have been seen before. 5. Predictive analytics allow researchers to develop prediction models that do not require thousands of cases and that can become more accurate over time. In huge population studies, even very small differences can be \"statistically significant.\" Researchers understand that randomly assigned case control studies are superior to observational studies, but often it is simply not feasible to carry out such a design.

For example, in a TEDxColumbiaEngineering talk, Dr. David H.

Many news programs and newspapers loudly and erroneously warned women not to drink even one alcoholic drink per day. In contrast with predictive analytics, initial models in can be generated with smaller numbers of cases and then the accuracy of such may be improved over time with increased cases. The models are alive, learning, and adapting with added information and with changes that occur in the population over time. In order to make use of data across practices, electronic data record systems will need to be compatible with one another; interoperability, or this very coordination, is important and has been mandated by the US government. Governance around the systems will require transparency and accountability. One program suite, STATISTICA, is familiar with governance as it has worked with banks, pharmaceutical industries and government agencies. Using such a program will be crucial in order to offer \"transparent\" models, meaning they work smoothly with other programs, such as Microsoft and Visual Basic. In addition, STATISTICA can provide predictive models using double-blind elements and random assignment, satisfying the continued need for controlled studies. On the other hand, some programs are proprietary, and users often have to pay the statistical company to use their own data. In addition, they may find that the system is not compatible other systems if they need to make changes. When dealing with human life, the risks of making mistakes are increased, and the models used must lend themselves to making the systems valid, sharable and reliable. 6. Pharmaceutical companies can use predictive analytics to best meet the needs of the public for medications. There will be incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to develop medications for ever smaller groups. Old medications, dropped because they were not used by the masses, may be brought back because drug companies will find it economically feasible to do so. In other words, previous big bulk medications are certain to be used less if they are found not to help many of those who were prescribed them. Less used medications will be economically lucrative to revive and develop as research is able to predict those who might benefit from them.

Less used medications will be economically lucrative to revive and develop as research is able to predict those who might benefit from them. For example, if 25,000 people need to be treated with a medication \"shotgun-style\" in order to save 10 people, then much waste has occurred. All medications have unwanted side effects. The shotgun-style delivery method can expose patients to those risks unnecessarily if the medication is not needed for them. Dr. Newman (above) discussed the probably overuse of statins as one example. 7. Patients have the potential benefit of better outcomes due to predictive analytics. There will be many benefits in quality of life to patients as the use of predictive analytics increase. Potentially individuals will receive treatments that will work for them, be prescribed medications that work for them and not be given unnecessary medications just because that medication works for the majority of people. The patient role will change as patients become more informed consumers who work with their physicians collaboratively to achieve better outcomes. Patients will become aware of possible personal health risks sooner due to alerts from their genome analysis, from predictive models relayed by their physicians, from the increasing use of apps and medical devices (i.e., wearable devices and monitoring systems), and due to better accuracy of what information is needed for accurate predictions. They then will have decisions to make about life styles and their future well being. Conclusion: Changes are coming in medicine worldwide. In developed nations, such as the United States, predictive analytics are the next big idea in medicine –the next evolution in statistics – and roles will change as a result. Patients will have to become better informed and will have to assume more responsibility for their own care, if they are to make use of the information derived. Physician roles will likely change to more of a consultant than decision maker, who will advise, warn and help individual patients. Physicians may find more joy in practice as positive outcomes increase and negative outcomes decrease. Perhaps time with individual patients will increase and physicians can once again have the time to form positive and lasting relationships with their patients. Time to think, to interact, to really help people; relationship formation is one of the reasons physicians say they went into medicine, and when these diminish, so does their satisfaction with their profession.

Over time, however, admissions will be more meaningful, the market will adjust, and accomplishment will rise. Initially, revenues may also be lost by pharmaceutical and device companies, but then more specialized and individualized offerings will increase profits. They may be forced to find newer and better solutions for individuals, ultimately providing them with fresh sources of revenue. There may be increased governmental funds offered for those who are innovative in approach. All in all, changes are coming. The genie is out of the box and, in fact, is building boxes for the rest of us. Smart industries will anticipate and prepare. These changes that can literally revolutionize the way medicine is practiced for better health and disease reduction. I think about the Bayer TV commercialin which a woman gets a note that says, \"Your heart attack will arrive in two days.\" The voiceover proclaims, \"Laura's heart attack didn't come with a warning.\" Not so with predictive analytics. That very message could be sent to Laura from her doctor who uses predictive analytics. Better yet, in our bright future, Laura might get the note from her doctor that says, \"Your heart attack will occur eight years from now, unless …\" – giving Laura the chance to restructure her life and change the outcome.

She is an 82-year-old woman who has lived most of her life as a committed elementary school teacher. She is now retired, widowed, and carries a long list of medical diagnoses, including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoporosis, arthritis, and chronic kidney disease. She regularly sees her primary care provider (PCP), her cardiologist, her pulmonologist, and a nephrologist. She is prescribed a total of 12 medications, some of which are taken twice per day. She has to pay a few hundred dollars out-of-pocket each month for her medications, which places a significant strain on her fixed retirement budget. Unbeknownst to her, some of her brand-name prescriptions have ef ective, cheaper generic alternatives readily available, which would save her more than a hundred dollars each month.

As they place the ultrasound probe on her chest to start the echocardiogram, she realizes that this is the exact same test that she had undergone a few weeks ago, when it was ordered by her cardiologist to “check on her CHF.” It occurs to her now that she was never told the results of that test. Her multiple physicians use dif erent electronic medical record systems (in fact, her pulmonologist still uses paper charts), and they never seem to know what tests the other has ordered. One time she asked her nephrologist why she needed to have blood work done when she had just had blood drawn a few days prior by her PCP, and she was told that it was “better to just have it done here again so that it is in our system.” At her last cardiology appointment her cardiologist told her that she may need a pacemaker with an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD).

She trusts both her PCP and her cardiologist dearly and is not sure what she is supposed to do. Healthcare in the United States is fraught with complexity, fragmentation, inefficiency, unexplained variation, and waste. In order to navigate this complexity in ways that make care more affordable, safe, and convenient, patients and their caregivers will need to understand how to deliver and receive high-value care. This will require understanding the origins and root causes of our health system shortfalls, being able to recognize existing sources and types of waste, and learning new methods of delivering care. We have written this book for clinical caregivers and focus our attention on topics of direct relevance to those who provide clinical care. High-value care typically refers to maximizing the “quality divided by cost” equation—or, in other words, producing the best health outcomes and patient experiences at the lowest cost (see Chapter 4). 1-3 Despite the 23 seemingly simple and, perhaps, cold appearance of this definition, it is important to realize that there are many intricacies to best capture health outcomes and costs in a way that truly matters to all players in the healthcare system, including, most importantly, our patients. While clinicians may innately focus on issues related to overuse such as the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics, patients may view the creation of value solely in terms of an enriched experience in the way they receive care. 4 It is vital that neither of these goalposts gets overlooked in our quest to improve the overall value of healthcare delivered in our country. This book will aim to explore healthcare value from many different perspectives, often grappling with real tensions between the many stakeholders in our system. Ultimately, however, our goal is to provide tools for clinicians to better deliver the best possible care at lower costs.

Ms Jones’ care demonstrates the all-too-common scenario of unnecessary and redundant tests, ordered by well-meaning but inadequately informed clinicians, working in disconnected systems that do not effectively communicate. The effect of these problems is care that is less convenient, safe, humanizing, and affordable for Ms Jones. As she sits in a darkened examination room, wearing a thin cotton gown, sacrificing her time to receive a test that she did not need, she can take little comfort in the fact that she is not alone: up to one-third of healthcare may not actually make patients healthier. 5 And among Medicare patients, around half of echocardiograms, imaging stress tests, pulmonary function tests, and chest computed tomography scans are repeated within 3 years. 6 By some estimates, more than 40% of services delivered to Medicare patients provide minimal clinical benefit, thus are considered low-value care. 7 Ms Jones was also given conflicting recommendations without the knowledge or tools to make an appropriate decision. Her physician recommended an invasive treatment (an AICD) that may not actually benefit her. In fact, as many as 22% of AICDs—which are pacemakers that are implanted into the chest wall and have the ability to shock patients’ hearts directly if the machine senses specific dangerous heart rhythms— are inserted in circumstances that are counter to the recommendations of professional society guidelines. 8 All of this waste and inefficiency in the current healthcare system is astounding, and hardly defensible.

A LOT OF BUCKS, NOT A LOT OF BANG: THE HEALTHCARE COST AND QUALITY CRISIS In the United States, healthcare costs have exploded over the last few decades. Approximately $2.5 to $3 trillion is spent annually in the United States on healthcare, equaling nearly 18% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 (Figure 1-1). 9 The real issue is that despite spending more than anywhere else in the world, by a wide margin, our outcomes are actually subpar. The United States “ranks at or near the bottom in both prevalence and mortality for multiple diseases, risk factors, and injuries.” 10 Figure 1-1. National health expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. (Data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary. National Health Expenditures. 2013. http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-andReports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html. Accessed July 14, 2013.) Perhaps the easiest and most relevant comparison is that to our closest neighboring country to the north. Total health spending per capita in the United States is 82% more than in Canada ($7960 vs $4363 per year, in 2009) 11 (Figure 1-2), yet Americans are not any healthier. In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked the health systems of its 191 member states. 12 Canada ranked 30th overall. The United States was 37th. 25 Figure 1-2.

The Commonwealth Fund has created a health system scorecard that includes 42 performance indicators for comparing national spending rates with domestic and international quality benchmarks. In 2011, the US health system scored 66 out of 100. 13 In school terms, this is a failing grade. Put bluntly, by most measures the United States is spending a lot of bucks on healthcare, but unfortunately not getting a lot of bang. From a national health policy perspective, this is seen as a large opportunity for improvement in many ways, including how clinicians practice. For example, according to Stanford health services researcher Dr Arnold Milstein, if the average clinician in the United States practiced the way the best clinicians practice (in terms of health gained per dollar spent), our per capita spending might drop overnight by 15% to 30%. 14 Although clinicians may increasingly recognize an ethical duty to address societal healthcare spending (see Chapter 6), arguments focused on the national GDP may not be the most compelling to those on the frontlines of everyday patient care. It is not that the statistics we just cited do not draw gasps of horror. They do. Clinicians understand that the exponentially growing trend lines with numbers in the trillions foretell a bleak national financial future. However, many walk away feeling uninformed about how to really change their individual practice. This may be due to the fact that healthcare providers do not go to medical or nursing or pharmacy school to treat the national GDP. They are instead appropriately passionate about treating the 26 individual patients sitting in front of them. However, as discussed below, healthcare costs and wasteful spending do indeed affect individual patients. The financial harm to patients and their families can be substantial, 15-17 and clinicians can take responsibility for helping alleviate this problem. 18 Part of the challenge will be to reframe cost conversations that are typically abstracted to the population level within the clinician-patient relationship.

Medical bills are now a leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States, 21,22 and increasingly medical insurance does not necessarily protect patients from the high costs of medical care. More Americans than ever before are now enrolled in high-deductible insurance plans (see Chapter 2). At the same time, many routine health services are arbitrarily expensive, meaning that seemingly simple decisions that physicians make about testing could directly lead to thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs. 17,23 Even among Medicarecovered patients, the out-of-pocket costs can be astounding. In 2008, it was found that during the last five years of life, personal expenditures averaged $38,688 for individuals, and $51,030 for couples in which one spouse died. 24 Incredibly, it isn’t only those unlucky enough to get sick that are suffering from high healthcare costs. Skyrocketing insurance premiums are too expensive for most Americans to afford (Chapter 2). 25 In 27 2011, the annual premium for employer-sponsored family health coverage cost $15,073, a large burden even for middle-class families. 26 This strain on household budgets can cause further erosion of personal health, and clearly leeches resources from other imperatives of daily living.

Some of these first-person accounts are included throughout this book as “Story From the Frontlines,” to give voice to the many that are personally affected by the issues in this book, and to regularly remind all of us of the real-life high stakes at play. HEALTHCARE WASTE “In very large measure, improving care and reducing waste are one and the same thing,” said Dr Donald Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and former administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 27 A study by Dr Berwick and RAND policy analyst Dr Andrew Hackbarth estimated that approximately $476 to $992 billion is wasted in US healthcare annually. 28 Around the same time, the IOM independently placed their own estimate squarely in the center of this range, at $750 to $765 billion. 5,29 This waste represents up to more than 30 cents on every healthcare dollar spent. The effect on taxpayer funds is substantial, with at least $166 to $304 billion of Medicare and Medicaid spending squandered each year. 28 Warren Buffett, the famous American businessman, investor and philanthropist, has likened healthcare costs to “a tapeworm eating at our economic body.” 30 National healthcare expenditures, particularly those that are considered waste, divert major resources from other important domestic priorities, such as education, infrastructure (roads, railroads, and bridges), basic research, and other public goods. It drags down our global competitiveness in business, and thwarts social programs to support small businesses. Indeed, healthcare waste is detrimental at the individual, family, community, state, and national levels. 5 There are multiple contributors to healthcare waste. Using the categories recognized by the IOM, 5 these include • Unnecessary services (those that add to expenses without improving health) • Inefficient care due to systems errors and failures of coordination • Prices that are excessively high • Excessive administrative costs • Fraud • Missed prevention opportunities Unnecessary services As clinicians, when looking at the IOM pie chart of healthcare waste (Figure 1-4), our eye is most drawn to that upper right quadrant where the slice for “unnecessary services” resides","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 1 - The Current State of Healthcare Costs and Waste in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 1 - The Current State of Healthcare Costs and Waste in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 1 - The Current State of Healthcare Costs and Waste in the United States_6"}}],["1020",{"pageContent":"Fraud • Missed prevention opportunities Unnecessary services As clinicians, when looking at the IOM pie chart of healthcare waste (Figure 1-4), our eye is most drawn to that upper right quadrant where the slice for “unnecessary services” resides. This is not only because, at $210 billion, unnecessary services comprise the biggest proportion of the pie, but also because this is the area that 28 individual clinicians have the most direct control over every day that they care for patients. Whenever a physician places pen to a prescription pad (or enters an order into a computer system), she is liable to be contributing to the $210 billion spent each year on services that do not make patients any healthier. These are medications, tests, and procedures that are not evidence-based, go outside of guidelines, and, in a minority of cases, are known to cause net harm (eg, elective back surgery in certain situations), but are done anyways. Figure 1-4. Sources of waste annually in US healthcare. (Reproduced, with permission, from IOM (Institute of Medicine). Best care at lower cost: the path to continuously learning health care in America. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press; 2013.) As discussed throughout this book, the problem of overuse has become pervasive in US healthcare. 31,32 Recently, this culture of overuse has become a hot topic in the medical literature, 33-35 and the popular press has begun to explain the problem of overtesting and overtreatment to the public. 36-38 Let’s briefly consider the example of using a computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE)—a potentially life-threatening blood clot in the lungs that can be difficult to diagnose from symptoms alone. The story of CTA scans and PEs demonstrates the complicated relationships between overuse, overdiagnosis, technology, and the lack of a sufficient evidence-base to guide decisions. While some patients with PE dramatically suffer cardiovascular collapse and acute heart failure, others with ultimately clinically significant PEs may present with very vague complaints and lack clear objective findings on examination. 39 In fact, the possibility of an underlying PE is discussed nearly daily on medicine and surgical hospital rounds. Despite this focus, there are many gaps that remain in our knowledge for 29 appropriately diagnosing and treating PE. This has led to PE being called “a metaphor for medicine in the evidence-based medicine era.” 40","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 1 - The Current State of Healthcare Costs and Waste in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 1 - The Current State of Healthcare Costs and Waste in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 1 - The Current State of Healthcare Costs and Waste in the United States_7"}}],["1021",{"pageContent":"medicine and surgical hospital rounds. Despite this focus, there are many gaps that remain in our knowledge for 29 appropriately diagnosing and treating PE. This has led to PE being called “a metaphor for medicine in the evidence-based medicine era.” 40 At first glance this sounds like a compliment since most modern clinicians worship at the altar of “evidence-based medicine,” but Dr Vinay Prasad and his colleagues from Northwestern University and colleagues warn that they actually consider PE a metaphor “not because it represents a great success, but because it captures all the complexity of medicine in the evidence-based era.” 40 For many years the incidence of PE was stable at about 62 cases per 100,000 population. 41 Then in 1998, CTA became widely utilized for the diagnosis of PE. Over the next 8 years, the number of PEs diagnosed nearly doubled. However, despite these rapidly increasing number of PEs found and treated, the effect on mortality was very small. We were diagnosing and treating twice as many PEs, but we weren’t really saving many more lives. This pattern is consistent with overdiagnosis. 41 It would be one thing if we simply weren’t making much of a difference, but in fact overdiagnosis frequently can lead to significant harms. 42 As we began treating more patients for PEs with blood thinners, or anticoagulants, the rate of major bleeding complications increased rather dramatically—from 3.1 to 5.3 per 100,000. 41 Furthermore, the harms associated with CTAs are not trivial. They include excess radiation, which has been linked to future cancer risk 43,44 ; exposure to intravenous contrast, which puts patients at risk for allergic reactions and kidney failure 45,46 ; and moderate financial costs. According to some estimates, as many as one-third of the more than 1.5 million CTAs performed annually to rule-out PE may be avoidable. 47 While tests like excessive CTAs are relatively expensive and dramatic, even small-ticket items, such as inappropriate repeat cholesterol tests (“lipid panels”), can have large effects on the health system due to the high-volume of these lab draws. 48,49 And the cost is not only monetary.

In 2010, The New York Times described an internist in Boca Raton, Florida, named Dr Robert Colton, who said that his patients come in demanding treatments that are unnecessary. 36 He said that some patients come in with a reported chief complaint of, “I need an MRI.” And Dr Colton, when asked what he does in these situations, said, “I do the damn test. There is no incentive for me, Rob Colton, to reduce overutilization. If the person wants it, what are you going to do, say no?” 36 (Chapters 10 and 12 explore how to engage patients in high-value care shared decision making.) Some have pointed out that, in general, American patients tend to inordinately favor and embrace hightechnology options, are shielded in many cases from the true costs of these options due to third-party payer insurance, and may be improperly swayed by direct-to-consumer marketing. 33 This “perfect storm” for overutilization, as University of Pennsylvania Bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel and Stanford Economist Victor Fuchs have called it, has helped lead to overutilization becoming one of the most important contributors to the high healthcare costs in the United States. 33 Story From the Frontlines—“Uncertainty and Challenges of Being an Informed Patient” 30 T he patient—blue-eyed, red-haired, and healthy but worried looking—guided the doctor’s hand to just below the angle of her jaw, where a small lump was barely palpable.

After all, melanoma can spread through the lymphatic system, and her dermatologist checked carefully for swollen lymph nodes at every appointment to make sure the cancer had not escaped the scalpel and metastasized. Melanoma is a terrifying disease. When caught early, it is easily treated by surgical excision. When caught late, however, it is universally fatal. The doctor smiled at the anxious 20-something-year-old woman in front of him, told her it was most likely nothing, and then wrote her orders for a CT scan to look for more inflamed lymph nodes. You’re young, he told her, and if I were you, I would want this test to make absolutely sure that the cancer has not spread. For the doctor, that was the end of it—another satisfied patient, reassured by the advanced technology of modern medicine. As a medical student, I have witnessed many discussions between healthcare providers about this type of hyper-vigilant patient. These conversations usually go something like this: “Mr. Smith’s cough is probably just a cold, but he wants an x-ray to make sure it’s not pneumonia.” Or “Susie’s headache is probably just a migraine, but her mom wants her to get a lumbar puncture [spinal tap] to make sure it’s not a serious infection.” Doctors and residents may express reservations, but if the test or treatment is reasonably justifiable, they frequently bow to the patient’s wishes. After all, medicine is no longer the paternalistic discipline it once was; doctors today are supposed to enable patients to make their own decisions, not simply tell them what to do. And why not order a test if there is a possibility, even a small one, that it will reveal useful information—especially if the patient’s insurance will cover the costs? For the patient in this case—me—that visit was not the end of things. I walked out of the doctor’s office feeling temporarily reassured; after all, he told me it was probably nothing, and I could always get the CT scan if I wanted to.

But as the days went by, I found myself worrying more and more. Weren’t the CT orders sitting on my desk at home proof that there was something to worry about? On the other hand, I did not want a CT scan. Though I was lucky enough to have insurance that would have covered the costs of the scan 100%, I knew that CT scans were expensive, and I did not want to undergo a test that would take time out of my busy schedule, expose me to radiation, and add to the social burden of healthcare costs. So I made an appointment with a dermatologist. She listened to my story, felt the lymph node, and then looked me dead in the eye and told me that there was absolutely nothing to be worried about. The lymph node was soft, it moved around—unlike cancerous nodes—and it was on the wrong side and the wrong place to be related to the cancer that I had had on my shoulder. In five minutes, she was in and out the door and I was on my way, without a single test having been done. This time, armed not with test orders but with more information about why I should not worry, I felt infinitely more reassured. 31 Doctors often talk about patients coming into clinic “with an agenda.” They feel at odds with these patients, many of whom push for extensive testing. Yet in the end, the ultimate goal of most patients is not the testing itself—it is the answers that testing will provide. A provider who takes the time to fully explain the benefits and drawbacks of testing is likely to find that patients are much less desirous of exhaustive testing than they originally seem. In doing so, they are doing a favor for both the patient and the healthcare system that bears the cost of unnecessary testing. —Erin Plute. “Uncertainty and Challenges of Being an Informed Patient.” Costs of Care, 2013.

Errors and preventable complications When a commercial airplane crashes in the United States, it immediately makes international news and triggers investigations and public response. Luckily, these airline crashes have become extremely rare, and the risk of dying in an airplane is now around 1 in 45 million flights. 50 In contrast, in 1999 the IOM famously revealed that as many as 98,000 Americans may die annually as a result of preventable medical errors, 51 and this was memorably translated into the gut-gripping “jumbo jet crash each day” analogy. The outrage was both immediate and warranted. But now more than a decade-and-a-half later, the progress overall to improve patient safety has been rather disappointing. 52,53 Adverse events may still occur in up to one-third of all hospital admissions, causing costly complications both physically and financially. 54 According to one large national study that examined claims databases for about 24 million insured patients (including both private insurance and Medicare), more than 1.5 million preventable adverse events occurred in hospitalized patients in 2008, resulting in $19.5 billion in excess costs that year. 55 Care fragmentation As clinical care has become more complicated and specialized, it is increasingly common for patients to see multiple providers in different medical specialties, often located in different practices and healthcare systems. A Medicare patient sees on average seven different physicians. 56 But that is nothing compared to what happens when these patients get hospitalized. The typical hospital patient is seen by more than 15 clinicians during a single hospital stay. 57,58 Only a few decades ago the average was around two to three clinicians during a hospitalization. It is no wonder that three-quarters of hospital patients now are unable to identify the clinician in charge of their care. 59 This care fragmentation does not only affect patients. The typical primary care provider coordinates with an average of 229 physicians across 117 different practices. 60 If this sounds overwhelming and unworkable, that is because it usually is (see Chapter 9). Inadequate care coordination leads primary care providers to frequently lack important information at the 32 time of a patient’s clinic visit. 61 And that is if the patient even makes it to clinic.

About one-fifth of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospitalization, and more than half of these patients do not see any outpatient providers between these hospitalizations. 62 Imagine being discharged from the hospital after a weeklong stay for shortness of breath resulting from congestive heart failure. A few days after arriving home you find that you aren’t sure if you are taking your new medications correctly, so you call your primary care provider for advice. Instead you find out that your doctor was not even aware that you were ever admitted to a hospital. He does not seem to know anything about what happened during your hospitalization, the results of your tests, or the new medications that you were prescribed. The sad reality is that direct communication rarely occurs between hospital and primary care providers. 63 This creates an unfair, incredibly challenging, and unsafe situation. It is not surprising that the top complaint patients have traditionally reported about their hospital care is related to continuity and transitions. 64 Operational inefficiencies in care deliveries Poorly functioning work processes are characterized by unnecessary pauses and rework, delays, established workarounds, and a process that participants feel is illogical. 65 Unfortunately, a patient is likely to find a number of these situations during just 1 day spent in any average US hospital. In fact, those who work in hospitals quickly become adept at figuring out workarounds to complete otherwise complicated, or even broken, workflows. 66-68 These workarounds may be essential to effective care delivery in some instances, 69 but they also often pose significant risks to patient safety. 70 One common example is the upfront ordering of advanced imaging for patients in an emergency department (ED) prior to obtaining a surgical consultation “just in case the surgeon might request it,” thereby avoiding a potential bottleneck downstream. This may improve patient flow through the ED, but may also expose the patient to an unnecessary test, with unintended costs and consequences. Complicated workflows and necessary workarounds create costly inefficiencies and variations in care delivery. An inpatient asking what time their CT scan will happen today is likely to be met with shrugged shoulders and the response: “it depends.” The inefficiency in hospital care delivery has created a system where nurses spend less than one-third of their working time performing direct patient care. 71 Intern physicians spend even less time interacting with patients.

Just think about the wasted time routinely found at the beginning of most office encounters: “We in medicine actually institutionalized the waste of waiting,” Dr Gary Kaplan from Virginia Mason Medical Center noted during his lecture at the Association of Academic Medical Colleges Integrating Quality meeting in 2013 (paraphrased). “We created ‘waiting rooms’ where patients rush to arrive and then sit and wait for us.” The waste of inefficiently delivered services—which includes preventable errors and complications, care fragmentation, unnecessary use of higher-cost providers, and operational inefficiencies at care delivery sites— cost up to $130 billion in the United States annually. 5,29 Chapter 16 will discuss modern strategies applied by health systems to improve efficiencies and reduce 33 waste. Excessive administrative costs It is hard to imagine that anybody becomes a health professional because they love sitting at a desk and fillingout paperwork. Yet, many clinicians spend multiple hours each week directly interacting with health plans and performing other administrative tasks related to our payment system. Nursing and clerical staff usually devote even much larger amounts of time to this tedious chore. 74 In the United States, physician practices spend approximately $83,000 per physician per year on insurance company interactions. 75 This is four times as much as Canadians. 75 The discrepancy is at least partially due to the fact that American health services need to coordinate with multiple different insurance companies on behalf of their patients. Most patients under the age of 65 obtain health insurance from their employer who has purchased their insurance plan from a private insurer (see Chapter 2). This means that more than 1.5 million unique employers are purchasing insurance plans from more than 1200 insurers in the United States. 76 The costs of dealing with this excessive insurance paperwork are substantial.

Pricing failures We have outlined in this chapter a number of reasons why healthcare costs so much in the United States. But health economists Gerard Anderson, Uwe Reinhardt, Peter Hussey, and Varduhi Petrosyan put it a different way in the rather blunt title of their 2003 Health Af airs study: “It’s the prices, stupid.” 78 Despite Anderson and colleagues’ headline-catching study title, prices do not explain all of the differences between America and other countries. But it is indeed true that Americans pay more for most health services than any other country. For instance, an MRI in the United States may cost $1080, whereas the same test would cost $280 in France. 79 There is clear evidence that medical services in the United States are overpriced and are seemingly immune to normal market forces. In a properly functioning market, the price of a service should be equal to the actual cost of production plus a reasonable profit. But, as will be discussed in Chapter 3, the prices of many medical services in the United States plainly exceed this standard. 80 The terms “price,” “cost,” “charge,” and “reimbursement” will be differentiated and discussed in detail in Chapter 3, along with a conversation about price variation and current efforts to achieve price transparency.

By using stolen identities and bribing physicians to use their names, the thieves were submitting Medicare bills at the rate of $100,000 per week, eventually swindling an estimated $70 million from the government before the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) finally caught them. 81 This case was indeed sensational, but other cases of fraud have led to even more than just financial harms. Rarely, predator physicians purposefully perform unnecessary operations solely to collect from insurers. 83 One widely reported case was that of a 22-year-old semi-pro baseball player who was told that he had something wrong with his heart and that “if he wanted to live to age 30” he needed to undergo an operation to have a pacemaker placed. He knew that it would cut his baseball career short, but he trusted the doctor and underwent the operation. Months later he found out that the operation was never warranted and that the cardiologist who performed it had been convicted of billing Medicare for dozens of unnecessary heart procedures. 83 Most healthcare fraud is neither as dramatic nor as frankly malicious as these cases, but it costs us dearly regardless. Several schemes are used to defraud the healthcare system, including billing for services not rendered, “upcoding” of services or items (“upcoding” is using a billing code for a procedure or diagnosis that is more complex than the actual procedure or diagnosis and that results in higher reimbursement), providing explicitly unnecessary services, and receiving kickbacks. A common area of abuse is with durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs. The FBI estimates that healthcare fraud costs the country an estimated $80 billion per year. 84 Missed prevention opportunities We have already touched upon the rampant overuse of medical services, but it turns out that there is also a big problem of underuse for certain medical interventions as well.

Family physicians as team leaders: “time” to share the care. Prev Chronic Dis. 2009;6(2):A59.) Although it may be an impossible task, these missed prevention opportunities are costly both physically and financially. As the popular adage goes, “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Inadequate disease prevention in the United States results in greater illness and premature deaths. On a population level, improvements in health in the United States have not kept pace with that of other wealthy countries. 87 Morbidity (the relative incidence of a particular disease) and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the US health burden. 87 Too many Americans are overweight, lack recommended vaccinations, or have uncontrolled blood pressure. Disease prevention is largely the domain of primary care providers. Therefore, in order to shift the focus toward prevention, we will need more primary care providers in the United States and we must deliver more support for these frontline clinicians in performing these vital tasks (see Chapter 9). In monetary terms, missed prevention opportunities could be resulting in $55 billion in wasteful healthcare spending annually. 5,29 THE “VALUE” SHORTFALL: INADEQUATE HEALTHCARE SAFETY, QUALITY, AND OUTCOMES DESPITE RISING COSTS This chapter may paint a bleak picture of the current state of affairs in healthcare and the resultant “value shortfall” (Figure 1-6).

Indeed, the system may be sick but it is not yet terminal. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement has provided a framework for the United States to achieve high-value care through linked goals that they call the “triple aim” (see Chapter 4). The purpose of the triple aim is to simultaneously improve the 36 patient experience of care, improve the health of populations, and reduce per capita costs of care. Figure 1-6. The value “shortfall.” (Data obtained from OECD.) If we do not act, then too many patients will continue to experience unnecessary harms. Healthcare costs and waste will continue to grow, taking away from other important national priorities. And some patients will continue to have physical ailments replaced by equally distressing personal fiscal strains. It does not need to continue this way. This book will provide tools and resources to help transform the way care is delivered at the bedside by clinicians, at organizational levels, and on the national scale by way of major health policy levers. KEY POINTS: • Healthcare delivery in the United States has become increasingly complex, fragmented, inefficient, and expensive. • Healthcare expenditures are growing at an unsustainable rate for both the nation and for individual families. Currently, the United States spends more than 18% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare, and medical bills are the leading cause of personal bankruptcy. • Approximately one-third of all healthcare costs—more than $750 Billion—are considered to be 37 wasteful. These excess costs can be categorized into (1) unnecessary services, (2) inefficient care due to systems errors and failures of coordination, (3) excessive administrative costs, (4) prices that are excessively high, (5) missed prevention opportunities, and (6) fraud. • The specific definition for healthcare value can differ widely whether considered from the perspective of the patient, provider, or payer. There is general agreement that value should include cost, outcomes (or quality of care), and patient satisfaction. References: 1. Curfman GD, Morrissey S, Drazen JM.

Smith and Steven E. Weinberger ane, a 27-year-old woman, arrives to your busy clinic at the end of the day. She looks miserable and describes a lingering cold for the last few days, including sore throat, cough, congestion, and sneezing. Before you are even able to do an exam, she asks you for antibiotics. You examine her and decide she most likely has a virus, not a bacterial infection that would require antibiotics. In fact, you do not really think she will need any further diagnostic testing at all. So you ask the patient why she wants antibiotics. She tells you that she is getting on an airplane the next day to go to a series of important meetings. She is worried about strep throat. “How will I get antibiotics if I get sicker?” she asks. You look at your watch and notice you are running 30 minutes behind schedule. You worry Jane will be upset if you do not give her what she wants. With a deep sigh, you quickly write her a prescription for azithromycin. Antibiotics are among the most remarkable advances in modern medicine and have saved countless lives over the better part of the last century. However, when used incorrectly, antibiotics pose serious risks to both individual patients and the public health at large (we often wonder if the drug-resistant infections that catalyze the apocalypse in every modern Zombie movie are really that far off). Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases drug-resistance, leaving populations of patients vulnerable to resistant infections. Antibiotic overuse can also place individual patients at risk for allergic reactions, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and other highly unpleasant and dangerous side effects. 1 These risks are well known to clinicians—as are the decades of clear evidence, guidelines, and quality measures that argue against prescribing antibiotics in certain conditions, such as routine sore throats and acute bronchitis. 2-4 Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, even warned in a 1945 New York Times article: “… the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out….

I hope this evil can be averted.” 5,6 And yet, currently when someone is diagnosed with a viral sore throat, like our patient Jane, antibiotics are prescribed approximately 60% of the time. 7 For acute bronchitis, patients are prescribed an antibiotic more than 70% of the time—a rate that has remarkably been increasing over time. 8 Why is this happening? In many cases, clinicians overprescribe antibiotics knowingly and are “caving” to perceived patient demand. In a world that often forces clinicians to see more patients in less time (see Chapter 9), it may be easier to just write out a requested prescription rather than spend the time educating a patient about why she does not need the antibiotic that she specifically came to get. Now there is the added pressure that a patient may walk out of your office and immediately leave a negative review on one of the many public-facing doctor-rating websites (see Chapter 12). Nobody wants unsatisfied patients. However, as we discuss later in this chapter, perceived patient demand and actual patient demand do not always line up. It turns out that physician-patient communication—not antibiotic prescribing—is the most important factor related to patient satisfaction in 191 acute bronchitis. 3 Many different organizations have called for mandated “antimicrobial stewardship” programs across healthcare settings. 1,6 Antimicrobial stewardship “refers to coordinated interventions designed to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents by promoting the selection of the optimal antimicrobial drug regimen including dosing, duration of therapy, and route of administration.” 6 The major goals of these programs are to achieve the best clinical outcomes while minimizing toxicity and other adverse events, protecting populations from emerging threats to public health, and reducing excessive costs. 1,6 In other words, improving healthcare value, as we have defined it throughout this book. BARRIERS Antibiotic stewardship is but one example that highlights both the many real cultural, operational, and financial barriers that currently hinder the delivery of high-value care, as well as the extraordinary potential for improvements (Table 10-1).

Table 10-1 Barriers to high-value care Misaligned financial incentives Clinicians and policymakers do not always see eye to eye, but there is one thing that nearly everyone can agree 192 W on: a major barrier to improving value is a healthcare system that is replete with misaligned financial incentives. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the stakeholders (patients, providers, and payers) each consider the costs of care from their own perspective. In most cases, US providers are paid more for doing more. Conversely, doing less can mean decreased revenue for a delivery system and lower salary for a clinician. 9 The fee-for-service payment model rewards clinicians for maximizing the number of patient encounters and procedures but often does not reimburse for important, value-added activities, like telephone follow-up and care coordination, that improve the quality of care. 10 As discussed in the last chapter (Chapter 9), compensation models for clinicians are typically based on relative value units (RVUs). Thus, even in delivery organizations that have risk-sharing contracts at the delivery system level (see Chapter 15), their clinicians are still strongly incentivized to provide as many services as possible. If providers were reimbursed based on patient outcomes as opposed to the number of services they deliver, they would have stronger incentives to provide value-based care. But it is not only the clinicians - the vast majority of hospital executives, including those at nonprofit hospitals, are also compensated based on metrics related to productivity, rather than patient outcomes or community benefit. 11 There is substantial resistance to changing financial models at this point. The cost structure of a typical healthcare setting is relatively rigid due to a high proportion of fixed costs (Chapter 4) that are minimally sensitive to small changes in patient volume, resource use, or the severity of patient illness. 12 At the same time, the operations of the hospital are designed to optimize revenue by delivering as many services as possible. In addition, more clinicians are employed by hospital systems than ever before and may be financially motivated to use their facilities and advanced technology. 9,13,14 Many health professionals are well-intentioned and trying to do all they can to take the best care possible","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care_2"}}],["1045",{"pageContent":"more clinicians are employed by hospital systems than ever before and may be financially motivated to use their facilities and advanced technology. 9,13,14 Many health professionals are well-intentioned and trying to do all they can to take the best care possible for their patients, but it is hard to always do the right thing when placed in a system that floats on a river moving in the wrong direction. As examined in Chapter 3, the situation becomes even more messy when considering the misaligned financial incentives of other stakeholders in the system, including payers, patients, pharmaceutical companies, and technology vendors. Each party is encouraged to charge different amounts to different customers, all creating “chaos behind a veil of secrecy.” 15 Understanding the limitations of our current reimbursement models will help guide our work redesigning care delivery and realigning financial incentives with improved patient outcomes (see Chapter 15 on “Shifting Incentives”).

I practice (or practiced, by the time you read this) in an area that is what we often refer to as “underserved.” Rather, the area isn’t, but the people I treat are. I work in a large urban referral center that has a very high proportion of Medicaid, as well as unfunded patients. No one else in town will touch 193 them. I am not blaming them—they are in private practice and they cannot cover their expenses if they are paid nothing or close to nothing for their time and supplies. While there may be an element of greed, it is not all greed. I know my colleagues in private practice and, almost without exception, I respect them all as physicians and people. In my referral center, the hospital has favorable contracts with Medicaid that yield good revenue for the center from Medicaid patients. But, as a consequence, all of my procedures are “hospital-based” as opposed to “clinic-based.” It is a semantic billing distinction that I do not completely understand myself (another part of the problem) and it allows the hospital to generate enough revenue to cover costs for an unquestionably needy population.

I am on salary and do not make an extra nickel either way. Which is why when Mr. Jones, an overweight diabetic with private insurance presented with a small local infection that I probably could have addressed in the office, I took him to the OR. His insurance company would only cover the costs if it were done upstairs, but would pay nothing if I did it in my clinic. Once in the OR, the regional block he received did not work well (which happens) and his sedation was increased. The increased sedation made it difficult for him to breathe and he had to be ventilated emergently. He lost his airway. His oxygen saturation dipped below 60% of normal, briefly, and the anesthesiologists were able to right the ship and wake him up. Ultimately, things went well. The patient’s hand was healed and he didn’t face a medical bill that would have decimated his financial health.

(www.costsofcare.org) Time pressure As the story that opens this chapter illustrates, time pressure is frequently identified by practicing clinicians as a significant barrier to delivering the best possible care. This is hardly surprising. Remember from Chapter 1 that it would take 21 hours a day for a primary care provider to provide all of the care recommended to meet his patients’ acute, preventive, and chronic disease management needs. 16 Often, the way clinicians deal with time pressure is by looking for ways to decrease their workload.

Instead of ordering one test and then waiting for the result before ordering more, ordering several tests at once may be more expeditious. Pressure to reduce 194 waiting times is one of the most significant sources of stress for ED staff. 17 Similarly, hospital physicians under pressure to decrease length of stay may order multiple tests and consultations simultaneously to expedite patient disposition. In a different era of practicing medicine, diagnoses were often clarified by just relying on a “tincture of time.” In our hospitals and ambulatory offices, there is little patience for this approach despite the evidence that “watchful waiting” (sometimes referred to as “expectant management”) is a feasible plan for patients with unexplained complaints and it does not result in delayed testing. 18 Indeed, as length of stay has decreased, there is some evidence that it does not actually result in overall cost savings, but instead merely shifts the increased costs to the ambulatory setting. 19 In the ambulatory setting, time pressure also drives inappropriate use of tests and treatments. As our story illustrates, it can be quicker to write a prescription or order a test than it is to explain to a patient why these interventions may not be necessary. Shorter office visits, particularly those less than 15 minutes, are more likely to lead to inappropriate prescribing. 20 Recent studies exploring barriers to improved outcomes in hypertensive patients highlight the association of improved therapy adherence with strong patient-provider relationships. 21 Provider time might be better spent establishing and maintaining continuous healing relationships with patients than ordering tests and treatments that are unlikely to improve patient outcomes. In fact, this “time pressured” approach to care delivery may result in the creation of unnecessary additional workload from checking results, informing patients of results, and providing follow-up testing or treatment that occurs from the discovery of incidental findings. There are multiple components of care that are affected by time, including patient satisfaction, outcomes of chronic diseases, prescribing practices, physician satisfaction, and risk of malpractice claims. 22 Throughout healthcare, poorly functioning work processes are created by unnecessary pauses and rework, delays, and established workarounds. 23 The inefficiency in hospital care delivery has created a system where nurses spend less than one-third of their working time performing direct patient care. 24 In turn, time pressure, burnout, and workload","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care_5"}}],["1048",{"pageContent":"delays, and established workarounds. 23 The inefficiency in hospital care delivery has created a system where nurses spend less than one-third of their working time performing direct patient care. 24 In turn, time pressure, burnout, and workload for nurses have been associated with patient safety risks. 25,26 Healthcare system fragmentation Clinicians may become accustomed to some of the pressures and flaws inherent in the current healthcare system, but the maddening fragmentation is starkly obvious to patients and their families. In healthcare provider offices, faxes—yes, faxes, in 2014—often provide vital documents such as discharge summaries or home care orders. These flimsy sheets of paper that often never make it to the provider or to the patient’s chart, symbolize our antiquated and insufficient systems of communications in healthcare. Left with increasing provider specialization, poor continuity of care, and insufficient communication among providers, patients, and families, the modern-day US healthcare system is incredibly complex and fragmented—a single patient often receives care from multiple clinicians who work in different facilities. 19,27 This fragmentation may lead to duplication of tests and confusion about the care plan and often results in poor outcomes at a higher cost. In the United Kingdom, discontinuity of care was associated with decreased rates of cancer screening and prevention, and when these deficits were addressed in a national program, outcomes improved. 27 Healthcare providers have been encouraged to transition to the use of electronic health records (EHR) 195 through a Federal initiative called the “meaningful use” program in hopes that patient records could be more easily shared and communication among providers would be enhanced. However, the current EHR system has not lived up to this promise because electronic records at one health facility are rarely compatible with those at another facility. 28 Even within the same hospital system, it is not uncommon to find that the inpatient and outpatient electronic records are not connected. When information is not easily accessible, providers often opt to duplicate testing rather than spend the time trying to track down previous results. 29 Improving communication, continuity and access in such a way that incentivizes providers to have ongoing healing relationships with their patients would go a long way in combating the fragmented system, reducing waste and improving health outcomes.

Currently, considerable investments are made to improve healthcare by developing better drugs and devices. In many cases the gains of creating a more reliable system far outweigh any potential benefits of more effective therapeutics. 30 Let’s consider a clinical example that has been highlighted by Dr Steven Woolf and colleagues from Virginia Commonwealth University in a 2005 “Annals of Family Medicine” article. 30 The use of aspirin by patients who have previously had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA, sometimes referred to as a “mini-stroke”) may reduce the incidence of a recurrent nonfatal stroke by 23%. 31 This is a remarkable benefit for a devastating disease. Yet, antiplatelet therapy is given to only 58% of eligible patients. 32 This means that for every 100,000 people that have suffered a prior stroke or TIA, there will be 9660 additional strokes that could have been prevented if everyone was appropriately taking aspirin. The pharmaceutical industry invested heavily in creating antiplatelet drugs that are more effective than aspirin, developing clopidogrel and ticlopidine with extensive testing. These medications are about 10% to 12% more effective than aspirin at preventing stroke events. However, a proportional improvement of 74% in efficacy would be required to see benefits that would reach the same level as making sure that everyone that should get aspirin actually does (Figure 10-1). 30 As Dr Woolf and colleagues point out, “It is worth asking whether the resources expended for the antiplatelet trials might have prevented more vascular events if they were invested in better systems for the delivery of aspirin.” 30 196 Figure 10-1.

The promise to relieve patients and healthcare professionals of the broken processes of a healthcare system that handicaps the delivery of effective medical care is a welcome sign. Imprecise measurement Healthcare value is often defined differently in different contexts and is challenging to measure in a standard and precise way. As we discussed in Chapter 4, considering value as quality divided by cost may be oversimplified. In many situations we are missing good outcome measure definitions, as well as accurate patient-centered cost information. Even in conditions for which we have robust evidence about processes and measures that work, accurately showing improvement in outcomes can be fraught with challenges. There are serious technical issues involving the quality of available data (most of what we know about the health system comes from high-level insurance claims, not from detailed clinical records), as well as the methods involved in adjusting for appropriate differences between patients and considering the right time frame for tracking outcomes. 33 And that is only part of it. Outcomes are based on thousands of factors, only some of which we actually understand or are in our control. Decades of research have led to significantly improved outcomes in 197 the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, 34 or a “heart attack,” but even here where we reasonably know which processes lead to better outcomes—unlike nearly everything else we do in medicine—process improvements explained only 6% of the total outcome variance. 35 The other 94% remains a black box. Often we think of “value-based care” as care that weighs the potential benefits of a given medical intervention against its costs and harms. 36,37 However, measuring cost in healthcare is incredibly complicated. 38-40 Furthermore, remember that value must also consider benefits and outcomes that are important to patients, which include patient satisfaction and care experiences. 41 Our ability to assess outcomes in a more comprehensive way that takes into account quality of life associated with particular conditions is woefully inadequate. 37 Thus, regardless of how high-value care is specifically defined, measuring each of its components can prove elusive. This lack of measurement may actually be driving some areas of healthcare costs. In the rapidly progressing area of oncology, the absence of both suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies has been cited as a major cost driver by an expert panel composed of healthcare professionals, cancer survivors and policy makers. 42 This deficiency has led to the alarming trend of declining access to evidence-based cancer care in developed countries. 42 Even as the Affordable Care","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care_8"}}],["1051",{"pageContent":"cited as a major cost driver by an expert panel composed of healthcare professionals, cancer survivors and policy makers. 42 This deficiency has led to the alarming trend of declining access to evidence-based cancer care in developed countries. 42 Even as the Affordable Care Act has attempted to help address these deficiencies with the creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which aims to “help people make informed healthcare decisions, and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes, by producing and promoting high integrity, evidence-based information” 43 the law explicitly forbids PCORI from using “a dollars-per-quality adjusted life year (or similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual’s disability) as a threshold to establish what type of healthcare is cost effective or recommended” 44 (see Chapter 8). Even in areas where high-quality data exist, providers may be uncomfortable interpreting results from comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature, as these types of analyses are relatively new and providers may have little training regarding how to interpret the results. 45 Even under the best conditions, the diffusion of high-quality evidence and guideline-recommended care into practices at the bedside is notoriously slow. 46-48 Lack of knowledge and training Further compounding the issue is that historically the medical education system has not placed sufficient emphasis on training physicians to practice in a cost-conscious fashion or to be good stewards of healthcare resources. 49,50 One study showed that less than a fourth of physicians tested came within 25% of the actual charge for 15 commonly ordered tests. 51 In addition, our current training model places a major emphasis in the inpatient setting, where medical interventions are readily available, easy to obtain and carry higher costs. 52 There is a general lack of reliable data in many delivery systems, creating a system where clinicians are constantly ordering off a menu with no prices, and then are shocked when they are shown the bill—if they are ever shown the bill. The good news is that many providers are currently motivated to learn about healthcare value and have expressed a desire to be more cost-effective in their own practices. 51 Chapter 11 will explore the many arising strategies for educating clinicians in the delivery of high-value care.

You present a patient admitted overnight with cough, fever, and an infiltrate on chest x-ray. After detailing a history and physical, you conclude, “This is a 70-year-old man with community-acquired pneumonia.” Dead silence. “Perhaps,” the attending finally says. “But what else could this be?” Your face reddens. “Pulmonary embolism,” you say. The resident nods. “Heart failure.” Now you’re talking. “Churg-Strauss,” you add. “The patient does have a history of asthma.” The attending smiles. “How might you investigate these other possibilities?” he asks. Next thing you know, the patient’s lined up for a chest CT, lower extremity Dopplers, echo, and a rheum panel. You get honors. And so it begins. This culture is pervasive and powerful. Much like the way that a poorly perceived patient safety culture has been linked to increased error rates, 56 it may not be possible to incorporate high-value care principles into practice unless this culture is acknowledged and addressed. 57 Every member of the healthcare team needs to be educated, empowered and rewarded for speaking up and identifying ways to make care safer and more costeffective.

Discomfort with risk and diagnostic uncertainty Providers and patients have expressed clear aversion to diagnostic uncertainty and often order additional confirmatory tests “just to be sure.” 58 Both clinicians and patients often overvalue being certain and overestimate the ability of diagnostic tests to give us the answers we so desperately seek. In fact, clinicians may avoid considering options where information is missing or where the probability is unknown. 59 This tendency is sometimes called “ambiguity bias.” “Personal risk aversion” (as opposed to consideration of malpractice risk) has also been associated with an increased intensity of care for certain conditions including the decisions of emergency physicians to admit patients to the hospital with acute chest pain. 60 Those physicians who were personally less risk averse were more likely to discharge patients with acute chest pain from the ED than were physicians who were more risk averse. Self-reported physician risk-taking behaviors also predicted whether or not imaging was ordered for patients with abdominal pain, whereas malpractice fear did not. 61 Furthermore, clinicians who are less confident in their diagnostic accuracy have been shown to be more likely to request more resources. 62 In their 199 quest for certainty, providers and patients tend to underestimate the downstream costs associated with confirmatory testing, including financial and opportunity costs, anxiety, false positive rates, incidental findings, overdiagnosis, and radiation exposure. 36,63 Commonly, reassurance is given as justification for further testing. A meta-analysis of trials in which patients with a low probability of disease were randomized to receive initial diagnostic testing versus a nontesting approach found no benefits of diagnostic testing on reducing illness worry or anxiety. 64 In fact, more testing frequently uncovers further unclear findings that send clinicians and their patients down a rabbit hole of more “recommended follow-up” tests, and ultimately may create increased undue worry and harms. 65 Fear of malpractice liability The effect of defensive medicine on overall healthcare costs has been estimated at $55.6 billion annually, or 2.4% of total healthcare spending in 2008. 66 Despite this relatively low estimate, defensive medicine is highly prevalent, particularly in areas of the country with high malpractice premiums, and may be a driver of variability in practice patterns throughout the nation.

Fifty-two percent of practicing physicians participating in a national survey identified fear of malpractice as a major reason for ordering unnecessary tests on patients. 67 In Pennsylvania 93% of physicians reported practicing defensive medicine, which resulted in the combination of overuse of unnecessary services like imaging and consultation, and underuse of high-risk invasive procedures. 68 This study highlighted how pervasive the problem is in areas with high malpractice rates and the resultant twin problems of overuse and underuse of services. Although both clinicians and patients perceive that fear of malpractice is a key driver of low-value care in this country and needs to be addressed, the effect of tort reform efforts on clinical decision-making has not been clearly demonstrated. Clinicians’ concerns about malpractice risk may be much more significant than their actual risk. State tort reform laws that directly limit malpractice damage payments have had little impact on state healthcare expenditures. 69 Physicians who report a high level of malpractice concern are more likely to engage in defensive practices, but there is no correlation with their actual state-level indicators of malpractice risk. 70 Furthermore, physicians’ fears of malpractice lawsuits are not eased by tort reforms. 71 In general, clinicians fear being sued, period. The amount of the payout is generally not the motivator for defensive medicine. It seems that “reducing defensive medicine may require approaches focused on physicians’ perceptions of legal risk and the underlying factors driving those perceptions” 70 rather than truly on specific tort reforms. The fact of the matter is that unfortunately, malpractice claims can be arbitrary and hard to prevent; 40% of malpractice claims do not involve any medical error at all. 72 Furthermore, more care is not better care, as tests and treatments have harms associated with them that may lead to malpractice. Also, lack of follow-up of abnormal test results can lead to malpractice litigation. Once again, there is a good reason to not order a test if you do not plan on appropriately following it up and acting on the results. The only effective ways to try to ward off malpractice claims may be to listen to your patients and carefully document decision making, including discussion of side effects and risks of all tests and treatments, and to have clear and open communication with patients and families following medical errors. 73 Patient expectations 200 Both actual patient expectations and perceived patient expectations are drivers of unnecessary","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care_12"}}],["1055",{"pageContent":"document decision making, including discussion of side effects and risks of all tests and treatments, and to have clear and open communication with patients and families following medical errors. 73 Patient expectations 200 Both actual patient expectations and perceived patient expectations are drivers of unnecessary care. For instance, physicians often choose to give antibiotics even when they are not indicated, because they perceive the patient wants them. But this perception may be incorrect. In a study done in 10 academic EDs, physicians were five times more likely to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily if they perceived that patients wanted them. 74 Interestingly, these physicians were correct about their patients’ desires only a quarter of the time. Furthermore, patient satisfaction has not actually been linked to whether or not the patient receives an antibiotic prescription at all, but rather is tied to improved communication. 3,74 Nonetheless, much like with malpractice fears, perceived barriers may be just as powerful determinants of clinician behavior as real barriers. A systematic review of patients with back pain showed that patients had explicit expectations of their providers. The most important of which were acknowledging their pain, performing a physical examination, providing a clear explanation of what was causing the pain, and defining a clear plan for treatment and followup. Some patients did indeed expect imaging and specialist referral, but these hopes had a lower effect on overall satisfaction. 75 In addition, a broad-based patient survey identified communication and follow-up as key influencers of patient satisfaction. 76 What patients really want is a clear diagnosis, shared decision making, and acknowledgment that their symptoms are real. Asking patients up front about their expectations and creating a clear follow up plan may constitute a practical approach to simultaneously avoiding unnecessary care and improving patient satisfaction (see also Chapter 12). As we engage in our work to improve patient outcomes, we must be aware of the many barriers to highvalue care and make a conscious effort to simultaneously address both individual and system-based obstacles. KEY POINTS: • Both systemic and bedside clinical barriers contribute to the difficulty clinicians experience in practicing high-value care. These barriers include misaligned financial incentives, time pressures, lack of knowledge, culture, malpractice litigation fears, and patient expectations. • Clinicians may have more control over bedside barriers to high-value care than they do over systemic ones, though these different types of barriers are often interrelated and are more likely to be overcome if systemic and bedside barriers are addressed together. • The improvement of healthcare value is complicated by difficulties with accurately defining and measuring the components of","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 10 - Barriers to Providing High-Value Care_13"}}],["1056",{"pageContent":"they do over systemic ones, though these different types of barriers are often interrelated and are more likely to be overcome if systemic and bedside barriers are addressed together. • The improvement of healthcare value is complicated by difficulties with accurately defining and measuring the components of value, which include benefits, harms, and cost, as well as downstream effects and patient perspectives. • Many clinical barriers can be overcome by engaging all members of the healthcare team, including patients and families, in discussions about high-value care principles and practice.

My wrist, moving frantically left to right on my page taking notes, stopped. I looked up and my mind wandered: What an odd message to tell those who will be listening to ill people’s symptoms, prescribing medicine, ordering tests, and orchestrating people’s care to not worry about costs. We have set up this dichotomy of treating the patient or being concerned with costs. We have soaked medicine with the belief that cost-conscious care is rationing at the bedside and the public is fed fear messages that clinicians who care about costs are limiting their care. How can we teach future clinicians to be so out-of-touch with one of the greatest concerns that many patients have when seeing a clinician? We know that people forgo medications because of high prices, medical bankruptcy plagues many, and that some cannot seek care due to cost. What other industries allow someone so crucially involved in controlling costs immunity from worrying about them? Does medicine’s unique role of saving lives exempt it from keeping an eye on the register? Is good care not cost-conscious care? Clinicians do not have the luxury to not care about costs. —adapted from Sarah Jorgenson, Costs of Care, 2013 As Sarah Jorgenson eloquently highlights, teaching medical students how to consider costs while caring for patients is uncommon—in fact, clinicians are often taught to specifically ignore costs. But times are changing, and recently, there have been increasing calls for medical education to train cost-conscious physicians. 1 Educating physicians to be “cost aware” is now becoming a critical responsibility of medical schools and residency programs. The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has included cost awareness and stewardship into its systems-based practice competency; residents are asked “to incorporate considerations of cost awareness and risk-benefit analysis in patient and/or population-based care as appropriate.” 2 To raise the visibility of this need, the American College of Physicians (ACP) has proposed that high-value, cost-conscious care be added as a standalone “7th core competency” of residency education. 3 MEDICAL EDUCATION AND VALUE-BASED CARE Although current efforts to integrate value-based care into medical training may appear new, it may be surprising to learn that","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine_0"}}],["1066",{"pageContent":"care be added as a standalone “7th core competency” of residency education. 3 MEDICAL EDUCATION AND VALUE-BASED CARE Although current efforts to integrate value-based care into medical training may appear new, it may be surprising to learn that such efforts actually date back to as early as 1975! In that year, Harvard Professor of Medicine Dr Howard Hiatt famously encouraged physicians collaborate with other experts and the public to protect the medical commons (see Chapter 5). 4 In 1984, UCSF Professor of Medicine Dr Stephen Schroeder and colleagues rigorously evaluated an educational intervention, which included a weekly lecture as well as audit and feedback, designed to reduce lab and radiology use at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF). Unfortunately, there was no significant effect on total hospital charges. 5 One reason such prior efforts have not resulted in widespread change could be in part due to the local nature of the efforts, in 208 addition to the myriad of cultural, operational, and systemic challenges such innovations have faced, including the need to align stakeholder interests and integrate novel material into already crowded curricula. But now, cost-containment has become an urgent national priority that is increasingly spilling over into clinical education. For example, policymakers and accrediting organizations have all expressed concern that residency training does not produce cost-effective physicians. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which advises Medicare on payment issues, has identified cost-consciousness as a critical deficiency in current residency training. 6 In fact, a MedPAC RAND Study in 2009 demonstrated that only 23% of 26 internal medicine residency programs reported their residents get training in cost-effectiveness. 7 A 2012 survey from the Association of Program Directors of Internal Medicine (APDIM) continues to highlight the lack of formal curricula in this area, finding that only 15% of programs had curricula related to cost, although an additional 50% of programs were thinking about starting one. 8 Furthermore, while the majority (85%) of program directors thought that graduate medical education has the responsibility to curtail the rising costs of care, just under half (47%) felt that their faculty working with residents model costconscious patient care.

The situation is no better in our nation’s medical schools. Data from the 2013 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Graduation Medical Student Questionnaire demonstrate that 63% of graduating students feel the training they received on healthcare economics was “inadequate.” 9 Of all the topical areas assessed, training in healthcare economics was judged to be the worst. Given the lack of curricula at both the undergraduate and graduate level, it is worth considering what obstacles exist. In both the RAND and APDIM studies, a lack of qualified faculty to teach and role model cost-conscious care was cited as a major barrier. Furthermore, the culture of medical training environments creates what educators often refer to as the “hidden curriculum” (as discussed below). It is not just that we are not taught much about healthcare costs, but the way that we’re taught may be actively training us to be bad stewards of healthcare resources. Value-based care in the formal and hidden curricula To address value-based education, it is important that we first understand how medical education is actually delivered in teaching hospitals. As Mayo Clinic Professor Fred Hafferty has recognized, there are several types of “curricula” that pass down knowledge and attitudes to medical trainees (Figure 11-1). 10 The most obvious and familiar to the casual observer is the “formal curriculum,” which refers to the actual planned lessons or written curricular objectives and content that are delivered to medical trainees. When asked about curricula, this is often the component that is discussed. But, a powerful and surreptitious undercurrent is also at work in medical education, aptly named the “hidden curriculum.” The hidden curriculum describes lessons that are not taught formally, but are learned through the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs conveyed in the classroom and the social environment. Medical education experts believe the hidden curriculum to be more powerful than the formal curriculum for instilling values, beliefs, and behaviors. Lastly, the “null curriculum” emphasizes that topics or issues that are not taught are deemed to not be important, thus often sending an unintended message to trainees. 209 Figure 11-1.

Data from Hafferty F. Measuring medical professionalism: A commentary. In: Stern DT, ed. Measuring Medical Professionalism. New York, NY: Oxford University Press; 2005.) To see how the hidden curriculum plays a major role in promoting a culture of overuse and waste, consider how medical trainees are often rewarded for suggesting rare diagnoses in the differential diagnoses for patients, and that many resident conferences, such as traditional morning reports, emphasize bizarre and very rare cases that require more intensive workups rather than focusing on the most likely diagnosis for the patient’s chief complaint. 11 Residents are also more often criticized for sins of omission than for commission. For example, a resident is more likely to be asked why he or she did not order a certain test than to be questioned about why he or she did order a test. Moreover, questioning whether a test is needed, opens up a trainee to possible criticism for “not being thorough.” 12 In fact, there are many reasons that trainees may overorder tests and it is easy to see how these relate to the hidden and null curricula (Table 11-1). 13 Actively tackling these reasons for overuse in the training environment clearly map to several of the ACGME core competencies, most notably, systems-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal communication, and professionalism (see Table 11- 1). Let us think about preemptive ordering. Systems inefficiencies in hospitals lead to an often-used workaround: to jump the gun and “preemptively” order a test just in case you might need it later, realizing that a delay in ordering could ultimately result in a postponed discharge. 14 As a result, many patients receive tests they do not necessarily need, which lead to both direct and indirect effects on patient safety. Unnecessary 210 testing can lead to patient harm, as discussed throughout this book. In addition, if, say, an MRI was labeled as “urgent” when it is in fact not, a less sick patient may take priority in getting a scan over a patient who truly needed it.

This is why the competency of interpersonal communication is so important (see also Chapter 12). In fact, studies have shown that through better communication, physicians are able to counsel patients to avoid unnecessary tests. In one study published in 1987, patients were randomized to receive immediate x-rays or a brief educational intervention for back pain. 16 After 3 weeks, fewer patients in the education group believed “everyone with back pain should have an x-ray” (44% education vs 73% x-ray). Patient outcomes were no different in both groups, and no serious diagnoses were missed. Story From the Frontlines: On Being 100% Sure s busy practitioners, we may forget that our trainees do not always have the skills to make cost judgments prior to ordering tests, especially when a test is just a computer-click away. As teachers, though, it is imperative we reinforce the fact that tests have costs and should only be used as adjuncts to our clinical assessments. The toughest thing to teach is what not to order. Unfortunately, medical economics is not routinely taught in medical school and we either never learn it at all or we learn it informally from our mentors, if we are lucky. The emergency room is an area where 212 we always seem to struggle with trying not to “miss a disaster.” A chief resident came to me to discuss a woman who presented with left lower quadrant pain that was suspicious for ovarian torsion, a surgical emergency. If you suspect it, you operate. She underwent a pelvic ultrasound that was completely normal, and by the time the evaluation was completed, her pain had resolved. Discharge; end of story, right? No. The resident, still concerned, wanted to observe her in the Emergency Room for four more hours and repeat the ultrasound to “double-check.” “Why would you do that? What risk factors does she have for torsion?” I asked. The resident responded, “None, but I want to be sure.” “If you’re that worried, then we should go to the OR, not wait for another ultrasound,” I advised. “I’m","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine_4"}}],["1070",{"pageContent":"she have for torsion?” I asked.

The remaining uncertainty, you have to learn to deal with. She’ll call again if the pain returns,” I said. It didn’t. In a time when there’s constant worry about potential lawsuits, it’s very difficult to embrace the concept of tolerating uncertainty. We are so used to being explorers trying to find the proverbial zebra, that it becomes harder to see the horse when it’s staring us in the face. That’s how these million-dollar workups occur when sometimes a tincture of time is the best treatment. I was fortunate to have teachers who helped instill the importance of clinical examination, who engaged me in understanding medical costs, but I am not perfect by any means. It is a continual learning process, which should be a formal part of medical training. Until then, all I can do is take baby steps, starting with myself and those I educate. Hopefully, many people taking many baby steps can work to reduce costs and provide better care, which, in the end, is our ultimate goal. —Padma Kandadai. “On Being 100% Sure.” Costs of Care, 2010.

For example, under the pathway of education on quality improvement, the ACGME states “the focus will be on the extent to which residents/fellows receive experiential learning in quality improvement that includes consideration of underuse, overuse, and misuses in the diagnosis or treatment of patients.” 17 Early experiences with CLER site visits demonstrate that residents are seldom engaged in systems-based practice and even when they are, their efforts to improve quality and safety may not 213 be well","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine_5"}}],["1071",{"pageContent":", and misuses in the diagnosis or treatment of patients.” 17 Early experiences with CLER site visits demonstrate that residents are seldom engaged in systems-based practice and even when they are, their efforts to improve quality and safety may not 213 be well-integrated with the approach of their institution. 18 In the summer of 2014, these gaps in physician skills for delivering high-value care prompted the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to issue a report that proposes radical changes in the structure and financing of graduate medical education. 19 In particular, the IOM committee recommended creating a new “GME Transformation Fund” to support efforts that help close the value-based care training gap. Based on lessons from the Transformation Fund pilot projects, they proposed tying how much an academic medical center gets paid to performance. In a New England Journal of Medicine article that summarizes their recommendations, committee chairs Gail Wilensky and Donald Berwick point out, “GME can and should be better leveraged than it has been to date for … meeting the needs of the American people.” 20 In 2013, The ABIM Foundation convened a meeting of stakeholders around promoting high-value care education for trainees. At that meeting, the following competencies, designed to be interdisciplinary, were proposed for trainees (Table 11-2). Table 11-2 Competencies proposed for Choosing Wisely The need for interprofessional training In addition to training physicians, there is a recognized need to train all health professionals in high-value care, particularly with a renewed focus on teamwork and interprofessional learning. The Macy Foundation has been a leader in advocating for interprofessional education and collaborative practice as a way of achieving the elusive “triple aim”: improving the patient experience of care, health of populations, and reducing the costs of healthcare. 21 While the concept of interprofessional education is not 214 new and has been advocated for since the 1970s, a renewed interest in team-based care has emerged as a result of the Affordable Care Act and other drivers. To meet this need, the Inter-Professional Education Collaborative (IPEC) was formed through a joint effort of the Association of American Medical Colleges, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Dental Education Association, and the Association of Schools of Public Health.

When the IPEC released its interprofessional core competencies, a key rationale was that team-based care represented a cost-effective way to meet patient, family, and community healthcare needs. 22 While initiatives to promote interprofessional learning are growing, high-value care educational initiatives have largely targeted physicians-in-training. This unfortunate oversight could actually undo some of the progress made by high-value care educational initiatives. Just as a single individual who fails to hand-wash may infect a patient and undo the diligent compliance of everyone else on the team, the efforts of some clinicians to cut wasteful practices may be quickly undone by a lack of understanding or skills from others in the healthcare system. The successful delivery of high-value care depends on major cultural shifts throughout the clinical environment, and [as Dr Ezekiel Emanuel has stated] the current healthcare cost situation calls for an “all-hands-on-deck” mentality.

Defining Competencies in Education in Healthcare Value: Recommendations from the University of California, San Francisco Center for Healthcare Value Training Initiative. Academic Medicine. 2014) STRATEGIES FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION TO INTRODUCE VALUE-BASED CARE As we consider how to incorporate value-based care into medical training, it is worth noting there is a wide range of strategies that could be employed, some of which are more feasible and impactful than others. In reality, to truly make lasting change in medical education, there is no easy solution. Medical educators will have to simultaneously employ multiple strategies to create true change. Incorporation into high-stakes exams Perhaps the most tried-and-true method of achieving widespread curricular change is to modify the highstakes exams trainees are required to take to progress during medical training. At the medical school level, this includes the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1 and 2, as well as the associated Step 2 Clinical Skills examination. Following residency, physicians obtain specialty-specific certification through secure exams administered by the respective specialty board, such as the American Board of Internal Medicine or the American Board of Pediatrics. In recent years, this method has been proposed as a way of introducing new and emerging competencies, such as patient safety. 23 Similarly, this may be an important lever for generating importance of value-based decision-making. 24 Current high-stakes","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine_7"}}],["1073",{"pageContent":"In recent years, this method has been proposed as a way of introducing new and emerging competencies, such as patient safety. 23 Similarly, this may be an important lever for generating importance of value-based decision-making. 24 Current high-stakes exams for medical students focus on basic or clinical science and do not include an emphasis on value-based care. Moreover, by design, sins of omission are more serious than sins of commission on the current USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills examination, which promotes a practice of increasing diagnostic testing and working-up every symptom that a standardized patient reports. 25 In graduate medical education, in-training exams administered to internal medicine residents by the ACP have started to make inroads by including a high-value care sub-score to highlight if the examinee’s choices on the test were the most appropriate and cost-effective. Other allied health professions could also incorporate principles of healthcare economics and high-value care into their high-stakes exams. Many pharmacy students are currently exposed to basic economic principles 215 in their pharmacy curriculums, but may have difficulty applying those theoretical concepts to actual patient care. 26 Nurses represent the largest labor force at the sharp end of patient care, and as such are well positioned to advocate for healthcare value. Unfortunately, nursing education, like medical education, has not yet formally integrated value-based care into their curricula or their high-stakes examinations. 27 Embedding into clinical teaching and residency evaluation In addition to high-stakes exams, residency programs have numerous other opportunities to integrate value into teaching. Dr Mitesh Patel (University of Pennsylvania) and colleagues at the University of Michigan highlight over 40 ways that value-based teaching could be integrated into residency programs (Table 11-3). 28 Apart from using structured formal teaching opportunities, Patel and colleagues also advocate for incorporating value-based instruction into clinical teaching, measurement and evaluation, and feedback. Natural “teachable moments” for high-value care on the wards could include attending rounds, discussions with social workers, and discharge planning for a patient. Using end-of-rotation evaluations, attending physicians could offer their assessment of trainee knowledge and integration of high-value care practices into their care plans. Lastly, feedback could come in the form of data-driven reports that target resource utilization. 29 Table 11-3 Opportunities for residency programs to incorporate training in value-based care 216 217 E-learning and social media The explosion of e-learning and social media provides new exciting opportunities to further facilitate valuebased","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine_8"}}],["1074",{"pageContent":"reports that target resource utilization. 29 Table 11-3 Opportunities for residency programs to incorporate training in value-based care 216 217 E-learning and social media The explosion of e-learning and social media provides new exciting opportunities to further facilitate valuebased care learning. Disruptive innovators in the educational space include Sal Khan, whose Khan Academy video-based tutorials have now infiltrated medical education through a partnership with the AAMC. 30 The Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Open School has directly marketed their electronic modules to learners, spreading concepts of quality and patient safety to more than 200,000 learners in at least 65 countries worldwide. 31 Likewise, the success of “MOOCs,” or Massive Online Open Courses, through sites such as Coursera have fueled some to suggest the future of medical education lies in this mechanism. 32 Recently, the Brookings Institution has launched a collaboration between the Khan Academy and the Richard Merkin Initiative at the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform to develop a MOOC aimed at improving clinician education about healthcare payment and delivery. 33 While it is unproven whether these methods will actually be successful in truly changing practices, the increasing spread of social media and MOOCs into mainstream medical education highlights such innovations in value-based education will continue to spread. It is noteworthy that the first known dedicated “tweet chat” on value-based care education on the popular microblog service Twitter attracted 68 participants who generated 489 tweets in 1 hour, resulting in a reach of over 1 million impressions. 34 The “COST” framework for value-based care interventions in medical education Since the principles related to the delivery of value-based care (or the lack thereof) are so widely prevalent in every aspect of medical practice, strategies to compel real behavior change should simultaneously target multiple different areas throughout medical education. One way to categorize these targets is the “COST” framework (developed by our Costs of Care organization), comprised of culture, oversight, systems change, and training (see Table 11-4). 35 While many educational interventions target training alone, successful programmatic interventions can have a more impactful and sustained change on practice patterns if they are coupled with objectives in other areas, such as changing the overuse culture, adding attending oversight, and/or embedding a long-term systems change to promote value-based care.

In other words, value-based care training must be baked in throughout the training environment, rather than merely added as a layer of icing on top. Table 11-4 COST framework for educational interventions for high-value care 218 • Culture: Perhaps the most critical element for true practice change, a cost-conscious culture refers to the institutional and organizational values that are consistent with value-based care. Changing the culture is not easy. Early value-based care interventions that have tackled culture were often multifactorial, addressing many targets all at once and involving the support of senior leadership. At Banner Health Good Samaritan Hospital a local competition was created to solicit trainee suggestions for the best ways to promote high-value care, with the winners being given resources from the institution to turn their suggestions into reality. 35 Another similar example is the “Caring Wisely” program at UCSF, as described in Chapter 16. Celebrating efforts to improve value can be a powerful way to create cultural change. As Dr George Halvorson, prior chief executive officer for Kaiser Permanente, has highlighted, something that is openly celebrated will naturally become a key component of that group’s culture. 36 • Oversight: Oversight refers to the use of attending physicians or other “overseers” to ensure effective stewardship of resources. Examples of such oversight are abundant in the medical workplace. Antibiotic stewardship programs—which usually require preapproval by an infectious disease service prior to use of an antibiotic that is associated with drug resistance—have become commonplace in hospitals, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called for mandated antimicrobial stewardship programs across healthcare settings. 37,38 In contrast to the proliferation of antibiotic stewardship programs, oversight is underutilized in other areas for preventing overuse and promoting value-based care. In teaching hospitals, lab utilization patterns are largely driven by interns, but attending oversight is frequently lacking, representing “a missed opportunity to reduce practice variation and improve patient care.” 39 219 • Systems change: Reengineering the process of care so that value-based care decisions are embedded into the workflow is perhaps one of the most powerful ways to promote value-based care and educate trainees in the process. Typically, this has been accomplished through the use of electronic health records and decision support, although less technological options are also possible.

Typically, this has been accomplished through the use of electronic health records and decision support, although less technological options are also possible. This could include making the prices of various tests available at the point-of-care, or enabling the prioritization of default options that are the highest value for a specific set of care options. For example, in a study aptly named “surgical vampires,” the very low tech option of a weekly announcement to surgical residents and attending physicians on the charges of the prior week’s laboratory services led to a reduction of over $50,000 costs in 11 weeks! 40 • Training: Beneath all of the efforts discussed above, a firm foundation of teaching and training to ensure mastery of principles and practices associated with value-based care must be in place. Education is likely necessary but insufficient to create lasting change. A recent systematic review of interventions to educate residents on cost-effectiveness demonstrated that most educational methods were didactic, and evaluation was limited. 41 Novel educational methods should also be employed that appeal to adult learners. The “COST” framework is useful for educational as well as operational interventions, and will be revisited again in Chapter 16. RESOURCES FOR MEDICAL EDUCATORS TO TEACH VALUEBASED CARE There are an increasing number of resources that can be used by medical educators to teach value-based care. For example, the Choosing Wisely Campaign, led by the ABIM Foundation, brought together an unprecedented number of medical specialty societies to issue their “top five” things “that physicians and patients should question” (available at www.choosingwisely.org; see also Chapter 5). 42 Many faculty report frequently downloading the lists to share with their trainees. 43 Likewise, the American College of Radiology has issued a set of Appropriateness Criteria that are designed to help clinicians decide on the most appropriate radiological tests for a certain condition (see also Chapter 14). 44 Didactic education is also now available to educators free-of-charge. One notable curriculum is the ACP High-Value Care Curriculum. 45 The ACP and the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine partnered together to produce a high-value care curriculum for internal medicine trainees, which has received over 17,000 downloads within the first 18 months of its release. The curriculum is case-based, available for free online (www.highvaluecarecurriculum.org), and designed","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 11 - Building a Pipeline of Change - Teaching about Cost Awareness and Evidence-Based Medicine_11"}}],["1077",{"pageContent":"high-value care curriculum for internal medicine trainees, which has received over 17,000 downloads within the first 18 months of its release. The curriculum is case-based, available for free online (www.highvaluecarecurriculum.org), and designed to be used by a faculty champion to train their learners. In addition, an independent quality improvement project on high-value care led by the learners is encouraged and tools are provided. The Teaching Value Project, which was funded by the ABIM Foundation and led by our Costs of Care team, is an online resource of video vignettes followed by interactive web-based modules that are designed to share fundamental principles of value-based care (www.teachingvalue.org). 46 Drexel University College of Medicine, with funding from the ABIM Foundation, has created a series of interactive communication modules focusing on how to communicate Choosing Wisely recommendations from nine medical specialty societies to patients. The modules are available free-of-charge on the Choosing 220 Wisely website (www.choosingwisely.org) and include short video examples demonstrating effective physician-patient communication related to Choosing Wisely topics, in addition to pre- and post-tests to assess knowledge acquistion. 47 Another resource that medical educators may find helpful is actually designed primarily for patients: Consumer Reports houses a wealth of information on the “best buy” for certain drugs for various medical conditions (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/best-buy-drugs/index.htm) (see also Chapter 13). 48 A groundswell of enthusiasm and efforts related to integrating high-value care into medical education has emerged across the country. To try to capture these local innovations and bright ideas, the Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely Challenge was launched by Costs of Care and sponsored by the ABIM Foundation. 35 From April 2013 to June 2013, bright ideas and innovations from medical educators were solicited to show how to best promote principles of stewardship among medical trainees. The results of the first annual challenge were quite robust and included 74 submissions from 14 specialties. Themes of the submissions reflected promising strategies to integrate and sustain high-value care teaching and practice into training programs. Several of the major themes are discussed in greater detail here.

Evaluation of I-CARE has shown higher ratings than the traditional morning report and overall favorable reviews by both attendings and residents. Attending physicians had significantly lower costs ($1027.45 vs $4264.00, p = .02) and higher diagnostic accuracy than trainees. 49 High-yield case vignettes Through the “Do No Harm Project,” developed at the University of Colorado, faculty work closely with trainees to identify and develop cases, protect a full day for writing time for trainees, and ultimately publish examples on the Web. 50 According to their website, the use of a traditional tool—clinical vignettes—provides a “potent way to humanize the harms of medical overuse and provide a persuasive counterbalance to the ‘more is better’ culture.” This effort has been so successful that it was recently translated into a formal journal series called “Teachable Moments” in JAMA Internal Medicine. 51 Linking didactic and experiential learning Other submissions highlighted the importance of providing experiential learning that drives home the lessons of didactic teaching. A medical student at Tufts School of Medicine extolled the benefits of spending a full day with the billing department in order to understand how the care she provides gets interpreted by medical coders. 35 Another medical student from University of Pennsylvania highlighted a new elective for medical students in which they are asked to compare a real patient’s true cost of care to the ideal cost of care. 52 Process improvement efforts Several programs used quality improvement tools to drive change in this area, specifically by tackling areas of 221 overuse. For example, Dr Valerie Ng, a lab medicine physician at Alameda County, California, has worked on “right sizing” medical tests through advocacy and working with clinicians to identify tests of low-value that should not be ordered. 53 Similarly, several trainees tackled specific projects that eschewed overuse of medical interventions.

One specific example is University of Toronto professor Dr Allan Detsky’s “Celebrating Restraint” model in which he highlights that if we were to train faculty to specifically reward restraint, our trainees would get a very different message than the current implicit standards. 54 A unique University of Colorado program goes so far as to use one-on-one coaching to promote efficiency during a month-long elective hospital medicine rotation. 35 Dr Gurpreet Dhaliwal, an influential clinician from the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, notes that, “Attending physicians have a responsibility not only to talk the talk but also to walk the walk if we hope to help create a generation of physicians who come to understand that the best doctors are often defined by restraint rather than action.” 55 He acknowledges that there are many remaining challenges and discomforts with this approach, particularly in the high-stakes atmosphere of teaching hospitals, but he also advises that he has “discarded one of the stock phrases for excessive testing: ‘this is a teaching hospital.’ I now think ‘this is a teaching hospital—so we are not doing an unindicated test or treatment.’” 55 Price transparency, feedback, and dashboards Price transparency through electronic health records was a common theme of several submissions, potentially resulting in fewer ordering of low-value tests. 56 In addition, many submissions also tackled the idea of using specific feedback at the point-of-care, either through decision support or through apps that would let you know how much money has been spent in the workup during the first 48 hours of admission. A faculty member at Johns Hopkins University proposed providing trainees with dashboards that include utilization practices so to benchmark their practices against the institution and other trainees.

KEY POINTS: 222 • Medical educators have traditionally been relatively silent on issues related to healthcare costs and value, but more recently, multiple forces—from healthcare leaders to policies and regulations to professional groups—have called on educators to address this deficiency. • The hidden curriculum in medical training, taught implicitly through the transmission of norms, values, and beliefs, plays a major role in ingraining medical practices, and must be adequately addressed to achieve high-value care. • Successful education programs in clinical training environments should address multiple targets including culture, oversight, systems, and training (“COST”). • Many resources and inspirational examples are emerging for medical educators to teach high-value care in diverse settings and across the spectrum of health professional learners.

Okay?” “Umm, okay, sure,” Mrs Moore, an 86-year-old widowed woman with severe congestive heart failure, hesitantly answered. “Great! It is always a pleasure seeing you Mrs Moore, thanks for coming today. See you at your next appointment,” Dr Brown smiled as he left. Dr Brown has known Mrs Moore for more than 30 years. He has helped her through dif icult times over the years such as the death of her spouse, and has taken care of her chronic hypothyroidism and more recently her worsening congestive heart failure. Mrs Moore truly respects Dr Brown and is thankful for their therapeutic relationship. A colonoscopy involves inserting a small camera on a telescope-like instrument through the rectum in order to examine the interior of a person’s large bowels. In general, the goal of a screening colonoscopy is to discover and remove polyps that can be precursors to cancer. But since progression from a polyp in the colon to a cancer is a slow process, it takes many years for patients to realize benefits from a colonoscopy procedure. 1 Also the procedure is expensive, preparation can be uncomfortable because of the need to take powerful laxatives in order to remove the fecal matter from the bowel, and there are risks of damaging the intestines during the procedure. Therefore, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) advises against routine colon cancer screening in patients over 75 years and any screening in patients over 85. 2 Nevertheless, Medicare pays for routine screening colonoscopies regardless of age, paying doctors more than $100 million for nearly 550,000 screening colonoscopies in 2009, with around 40% of those for patients over 75. 3 But the cost is not only monetary: life-threatening complications such as perforating the bowel significantly increase with advancing age. 4 Therefore, an 86-year-old patient with a life-limit","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_0"}}],["1088",{"pageContent":"40% of those for patients over 75. 3 But the cost is not only monetary: life-threatening complications such as perforating the bowel significantly increase with advancing age. 4 Therefore, an 86-year-old patient with a life-limiting disease like congestive heart failure is more likely to suffer from the risks of a colonoscopy than to ever see the potential downstream benefits. Overscreening patients for disease is a massive and growing problem in the United States. Elderly patients, often with multiple life-limiting diseases and/or advanced dementia, frequently undergo screening testing that will never benefit them. 5 Approximately 50% of woman older than 80 years continue to receive breast cancer screening, and more than half of patients older than 75 years report that their physicians continue to recommend routine screening. 6 For younger patients, colonoscopies may also present a personal monetary hurdle. Although insurance plans cover the costs of colonoscopy as a preventive test, if an abnormality is found (such as a polyp or growth) then some no longer consider it a “screening test,” and patients may be responsible for paying their entire 267 deductible or copay. 7 For patients on a high-deductible health plan (see Chapter 2), this could mean that the patient is responsible for the entire cost of the procedure, which may be up to thousands of dollars. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends: “If you are getting a screening colonoscopy, be sure to find out how much you will have to pay if something is found (and biopsied or removed) during the exam. This can help you avoid any surprise costs.” 7 This clearly illustrates the tension between patient affordability and societal stewardship; screening is cost-effective at the societal level and improves population health, but has the potential to be expensive for the individual patient and very rarely improves individual health. Many colonoscopies are performed unnecessarily, and not only in elderly patients. Following a negative screening colonoscopy, the recommendation is to not repeat the test within 7 to 10 years. However, in a large study, nearly half of patients underwent a repeated examination in fewer than 7 years, suggesting an epidemic of unhelpful colonoscopies. 8 In the right setting—a patient in the appropriate target group and obtained at recommended intervals—colonoscopies can be incredibly valuable, life-saving procedures, but too often these procedures are performed in situations without likely benefit.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_1"}}],["1089",{"pageContent":"helpful colonoscopies. 8 In the right setting—a patient in the appropriate target group and obtained at recommended intervals—colonoscopies can be incredibly valuable, life-saving procedures, but too often these procedures are performed in situations without likely benefit.

DEFINING AN EFFECTIVE SCREENING TOOL Effective screening tests should meet a number of conditions 9 : • Designed to detect asymptomatic and early stage disease • Highly sensitive and highly specific (see below) to pick up most cases of true disease and avoid falsepositives • Targeted toward populations with a higher disease prevalence (high positive predictive value) • Relatively safe and cost-effective to society (as defined by “willingness to pay” thresholds that vary by country or health system) • Screen for diseases in which early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes In 1968, the World Health Organization published formal guidelines for the principles of screening, often referred to as “Wilson’s Criteria” after the lead author, Dr James M.G. Wilson (Table 14-1). 10 These tenets form the foundation for screening tests. Table 14-1 World Health Organization (WHO) principles of screening guidelines • The condition should be an important health problem. • There should be a treatment for the condition. • Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available. • There should be a latent stage of the disease. • There should be a test or examination for the condition. • The test should be acceptable to the population. • The natural history of the disease should be adequately understood. 268 • There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat. • The total cost of finding a case should be economically balanced in relation to medical expenditure as a whole. • Case-finding should be a continuous process, not just a “once and for all” project.

There are different types of screening strategies that are commonly used in society, including: • Mass screening: the screening of an entire population or a subgroup, offered to all, irrespective of the risk status of the individual.

Examples include pap screening at age 21 regardless of sexual history; or HIV screening for all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years (as recommended by the USPSTF). • High-risk or selective screening: screening conducted only among populations at a particular risk for the disease. For instance, many genetically linked disorders are part of prenatal testing for specific patient groups (eg, cystic fibrosis in Northern European patients; Tay Sachs in Ashkenazi Jewish patients). Another example is early breast and ovarian cancer screening in women with a genetic disorder that puts them at high risk for these diseases (BRCA+ mutation). • Multiphasic screening: a technique of screening populations that combines the application of two or more screening tests (a “battery of screening tests”) to a large population at one time instead of carrying out separate screening tests for single diseases. This strategy is often employed by Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and corporate wellness programs to screen for “metabolic syndrome” disorders, and are also used frequently for prenatal immunity screening (single blood collection in first trimester to test rubella, hepatitis B, HIV, and other diseases). Brief biostatistics review It is vital that clinicians have a firm grasp on interpreting the basic test characteristics of all diagnostic tests. Sensitivity and specificity both measure a test’s validity. They describe the test’s ability to correctly detect people with or without the disease in question. 11 Therefore, they are critical to the evaluation of screening tests and thresholds. Let us briefly visit these concepts now. The equations for each of these biostatistical terms are presented in Table 14-2. Table 14-2 Biostatistical terms and equations 269 The sensitivity of a test is its ability to detect people who actually have the disease. A test that is 100% sensitive would always identify every person with that disease. Very sensitive tests are required in situations where the consequences of a false-negative result (a negative test result obtained in a case where the person does actually have the disease) would be extremely serious. 11 For instance, screening donated blood for HIV, in which a highly sensitive test is required to ensure that there are not any false-negative cases leading to accidental transmission of HIV. Highly sensitive tests are good for ruling out disease.

A test that always returned positive may indeed be a true-positive for every person with the disease (therefore, “highly sensitive”), but it would also be positive for everyone without the disease (false-positive); thus, it would remain a worthless test. The specificity of a test is its ability to detect people who do not have the disease. Tests that are highly specific are needed particularly in situations where a false-positive test would cause significant harm. For instance, prior to starting a toxic chemotherapy regimen for cancer, the patient and physician need to be quite certain that the test result is true and the patient does indeed have cancer. Highly specific tests help rule in disease. That is, that if a highly specific test is positive for a certain disease then there is substantial confidence that the patient does in fact have that disease. Ideally, screening tests will maximize both sensitivity and specificity, but in practice there is almost always a trade-off between the two; sensitivity is increased at the cost of specificity, and vice versa. This is usually because patients with a disease and without a disease are on a continuum and the two groups often overlap 270 each other. 11 The test must have a “cut-off” point that is chosen based on the specific test characteristics. Where that cut-off point is chosen may lead to either more missed cases (false-negatives) or more incorrect diagnoses (false-positives). A commonly used strategy is to perform a highly sensitive and rather cheap test first to identify all patients that may have a disease, and then follow up with a more specific (and usually more expensive) test to eliminate false-positive results. This approach is used for HIV testing. Sensitivity and specificity are very important concepts when designing or evaluating diagnostic tests, and when determining whether a test should be ordered in the first place. But once a test is performed, the individual patient and clinician want to answer a different question altogether. The patient wants to know, based on this test result, how likely is it that I do or do not have the disease. The answer of this question requires knowing the predictive values of the test.

The patient wants to know, based on this test result, how likely is it that I do or do not have the disease. The answer of this question requires knowing the predictive values of the test. The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the proportion of positive results that are true-positives. If a patient tests positive for HIV, the question is: “Given the positive test, how likely is it that I actually have HIV?” The PPV answers this question. The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the proportion of negative results that are true-negatives. If the HIV test returns negative, the question is: “Given the negative test, how likely is it that I really do not have HIV?” The NPV answers this question. The predictive values vary according to the prevalence of the disease in a specific population group. Using the blood test CA-125 to screen for ovarian cancer may be an excellent example of predictive values and the concept of the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. CA-125 may be up to 99% specific, but it is less than 80% sensitive. Since the population prevalence is so low, this results in an abysmal 0.4% PPV, thus rendering it unhelpful as a mass screening tool. 12 As Figure 14-1 shows, with these test characteristics if 100,000 women were screened, there would be approximately 10,040 positive results. The problem is that this would be a false-positive for 10,000 of these women, potentially subjecting them to further testing, undue worry, and invasive procedures. 271 Figure 14-1. An example of a highly specific test but with a low positive predictive value due to low disease prevalence in a population. LIMITATIONS AND BIASES IN SCREENING There are various limitations that are inherent to screening tests and are important for clinicians to consider when interpreting these studies. The apparent effects from screening will always be more favorable than real effects seen in a population. 13 This is because screening-detected cases include cases that were diagnosed earlier, progress more slowly, and may never actually cause a clinical problem.

The key is to understand the important difference between survival rates and mortality. Whereas mortality rates define the number of people that die of a certain cause in a given year, survival rates calculate the percentage of people with a disease who are still alive a set amount of time after diagnosis. Preventing death, curing the disease, or making the diagnosis earlier can all increase survival rates. 14 Consider this illustrative story by Indiana University School of Medicine professor Dr Aaron Carroll from the Incidental Economist blog 14 : Let’s say there’s a new cancer of the thumb killing people. From the time the first cancer cell appears, you have 9 years to live, with chemo. From the time you can feel a lump, you have 4 years to live, with chemo. Let’s say we have no way to detect the disease until you feel a lump. The 5-year survival rate for this cancer is about 0, because within 5 years of detection, everyone dies, even on therapy. Now I invent a new scanner that can detect thumb cancer when only one cell is there. Because it’s the United States, we invest heavily in those scanners. Early detection is everything, right? We have protests and lawsuits and now everyone is getting scanned like crazy. Not only that, but 272 people are getting chemo earlier and earlier for the cancer. Sure, the side ef ects are terrible, but we want to live. We made no improvements to the treatment. Everyone is still dying 4 years after they feel the lump. But since we are making the diagnosis 5 years earlier, our 5-year survival rate is now approaching 100%! Everyone is living 9 years with the disease. Meanwhile, in England, they say that the scanner doesn’t extend life and won’t pay for it. Rationing! That’s why their 5-year survival rate is still 0%. The mortality rate is unchanged. The same number of people are dying every year. We have just moved the time of diagnosis up and subjected people to 5 more years of side-ef ects and reduced quality of life. We haven’t done any good at all. We haven’t extended life, we’ve just lengthened the time you have a diagnosis.

We haven’t extended life, we’ve just lengthened the time you have a diagnosis. Lead-time bias Dr Carroll’s “thumb cancer” example highlights the problem of lead-time bias from screening tests. Since we determine the length of survival from the time of diagnosis, and screen-detected cases are diagnosed earlier than those detected by signs and symptoms, the measured survival length often increases with screening, even if that patient ends up dying at the same exact time they would have died without the screening test. The patient seems to have lived longer with cancer, but in reality they simply knew about the cancer longer. In Figure 14-2, the patient develops cancer in March 2013 and dies in January 2016. The only difference is that with a screening test, the diagnosis was made in January 2014; without the test, the diagnosis was made based on symptoms in July 2015. With the screening test, the patient is said to have survived for 2 years with cancer. Without the screening test, the patient is considered to have survived for only 6 months with cancer. But the reality is that she died the same date regardless. She simply was aware of the existence of her disease longer. Figure 14-2. Lead-time bias example. Lead-time bias helps explain why the commonly used metric of 5-year survival rates to judge the value of cancer screening can potentially be misleading. 15 Length-time bias Another issue is that screening overestimates survival duration due to the relative excess identification of slowly progressing disease, a phenomenon known as length-time bias. Screening tests disproportionately find slow-growing cancers compared to rapidly advancing cancers due to a much larger window of opportunity to 273 identify these diseases in an asymptomatic state. 13,15 In other words, “the probability of detection is directly proportional to the length of time during which they are detectable (and thereby inversely proportional to the rate of progression).” 13 The most important consequence is that the very nature of screening tests selects for cancers that inherently have a better prognosis. 15 Figure 14-3 demonstrates this concept, showing how slower growing tumors that are much less likely to kill someone within the given time-span are much more likely to be picked up by screening tests, compared to rapidly progressive disease that both develops and causes death within the screening interval.

Figure 14-3. Length-time bias. Notes: A total of seven patients (lines) are depicted. The length of the line represents the length of the clinical course. Even though the prevalence of disease is nearly the same in this hypothetical cohort, patients that survive during the period of observation (blue lines) are more likely to be detected during a “screening snapshot” than patients that die during the period of observation (black lines). This can skew perceived survival rates. The extreme of this is “overdiagnosis,” which is discussed in detail further below. Overdiagnosis refers to finding a lesion that is so indolent that if it were untreated it would never go on to cause problems for the individual. In 2012, the USPSTF recommended against routine prostate cancer screening using the prostatespecific antigen (PSA) test for exactly this reason. Before this guideline, PSA testing was widespread. In an effort to curb overuse of PSA, the USPSTF pointed out the multiple harms of overdiagnosis in their recommendations, including the small risk of death from unnecessary surgery. 16 Healthy volunteer bias 274 There is often something fundamentally different about people who agree to participate in prevention and early detection programs from those who do not. In general, folks that opt to participate in screening or prevention programs tend to be more health-conscious. On average, they are more likely to exercise, they smoke and drink less, and they come from higher socioeconomic classes compared to those that do not participate in these programs. 15 Therefore, at baseline this self-selected group of people seem to live longer in general than those that do not participate in these types of programs. In fact, this is such a common finding that epidemiologists have labeled it the “healthy volunteer ef ect.” 15 In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial—a large, multicenter program that randomized more than 150,000 men and women between 55 and 74 years to a screening or a control arm over many years—the standardized all-cause mortality rate was 43 in participants, whereas the expected standard would be 100. 17 Why did the men and women who chose to enroll in this study die so much less frequently (regardless of randomization to the screening arm) than would be","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_8"}}],["1096",{"pageContent":"rate was 43 in participants, whereas the expected standard would be 100. 17 Why did the men and women who chose to enroll in this study die so much less frequently (regardless of randomization to the screening arm) than would be expected in the general population?

In the United Kingdom, people expressed a clear preference to undergo diagnostic testing for cancer at all risk levels—88% of people surveyed said that they would want to undergo diagnostic testing for cancer even if the risk that their symptom actually represented cancer was only 1%. 19 When it comes to cancer, often emotion prevails over cold hard science. 20,21 However, interestingly, this fervor for cancer screening does not extend to other healthcare issues, such as heart disease, which actually kills many more women than breast cancer. 20 This is not necessarily surprising. There exist many persuasive stories and messages of people touting that a screening test “saved my life.” There is no doubt that this is sometimes true and that certain screening tests have made a substantial contribution to lives being saved. But, over the course of 30 years, screening mammography has had a limited effect on breast cancer mortality in the United States. 22 Although the introduction of mammography has been associated with a doubling of early-stage breast cancer cases detected each year (from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women), the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has only decreased by 8% (from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women). Therefore, it seems that only 8 of the additional 122 early-stage cancers diagnosed by screening mammography would have been expected to progress to advanced disease. 22 In an impressively large, comprehensive trial performed in Canada, nearly 90,000 women between the ages of 40 to 59 were randomized in the 1980s to either get annual screening mammography for 5 years or no mammography at all.

Well, remember the limitations of screening testing including lead-time and length-time biases. It has been suggested that as many as one-in-three women with breast cancer detected by 275 screening are “overdiagnosed”—they had tumors detected on screening that would never have led to meaningful clinical symptoms—translating to 1.3 million women in the United States over the past 30 years. 22,24 This means the reality is that most women with screen-detected breast cancer that claim to have had their “life saved” have not likely had their life saved by screening. 25 Instead, it is much more likely that these women were diagnosed early with no effect on their mortality, or they were overdiagnosed, such that their cancer would not have ever resulted in clinically meaningful disease. 25 The issue becomes even clearer as we look at screening in the elderly—the group that may be least likely to see long-term benefits from screening and most likely to experience harms. Many older adults think that “it would be strange” to stop cancer screening at any point during their lifetime. 26 Stopping screening feels like a major decision, whereas just continuing to go along with screening may not. Due to these deeply ingrained ideals, some have worried that “a physician’s recommendation to stop [screening] may threaten patient trust.” 26 As a result, as many as half of women over 80 years old continue to undergo breast cancer screening. 6 Not surprisingly, the largest predictor about whether or not a patient undergoes a screening test is whether their physician recommended the test to them. 6 More than 50% of men and women over the age of 75 report that their physicians continue to regularly recommend screening. 6 It is clear that clinicians are not immune to the phenomenon of “misfearing,” the term used to describe the human tendency to fear instinctively rather than factually. 20 Healthcare professionals demonstrate an inordinate fear of missing cancer, which undoubtedly shapes some of their overzealous screening practices","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_10"}}],["1098",{"pageContent":"to the phenomenon of “misfearing,” the term used to describe the human tendency to fear instinctively rather than factually. 20 Healthcare professionals demonstrate an inordinate fear of missing cancer, which undoubtedly shapes some of their overzealous screening practices. In the United States, more screening is happening more frequently… even when the screening test is considered inappropriate. A large cross-sectional national study comparing outpatient visits in 1999 to visits in 2009 found that while 6 of 9 underuse indicators improved, only 2 of the 11 overuse indicators got better, and in fact one of the metrics—prostate cancer screening among men older than 74 years old—got significantly worse. 27 Even patients with advanced cancer and limited life expectancies undergo screening. 28 Almost 10% of women with advanced non-breast cancer underwent a subsequent mammogram, and 15% of men with advanced non-prostate cancer underwent prostate cancer screening with a blood test (PSA). 28 This is crazy! One driver may be that many clinicians are drilled with quality indicators that indiscriminately focus on screening rates. In the Veteran Affairs healthcare system, an age-based measure for colorectal cancer encourages testing in patients aged 50 to 75. With this program, an unhealthy 75-year-old man was more likely to get a colonoscopy than a healthy 76-year-old man. 29 This highlights the need for future quality measures to focus on clinical benefit rather than simply age, and also to balance measures of underuse with those that gauge overuse. Clinicians may be able to reduce non-beneficial screening by including frank and informed discussions of risks and benefits, including complications and potential burdens, in their patient counseling. 26 In reality, clinicians rarely discuss the possibility of overdiagnosis and overtreatment when recommending cancer screening. 30 In contrast to much of the data highlighting emotions driving screening overuse, in a survey of Americans aged 50 to 69 years old, most of whom had undergone screening, over half of patients said they would not agree to screening if it resulted in more than one overtreated person per one cancer death averted, and almost all of them (87%) would not agree if more than 20 received overtreatment per one death averted. 30 276 “Wow,” wrote Dartmouth Institute researcher Dr H.

One particularly dramatic example comes from a patient I admitted to the hospital. A healthy 84-year-old woman underwent a routine colonoscopy and then immediately developed severe abdominal pain and hypotension (low blood pressure). She was transferred to our emergency department and underwent two CT scans and an ultrasound to determine that she had a splenic hematoma (bleeding resulting in a collection of blood in her spleen). This required an overnight hospital stay for monitoring and resulted in significant pain for the patient. In fact, over a month following discharge, she continued to experience pain from this complication. Splenic hematoma is a rare complication of colonoscopy, but occurs more frequently in females and the elderly. Most concerning about this case was that when asked, our patient stated that she was not aware that if cancer were found from this test that she would possibly have required colorectal surgery and chemotherapy, which she thought she probably would not have wanted to pursue anyways. Just like Ms Moore in the beginning of this chapter, she had never discussed the possible downsides of this screening procedure, nor the fact that colonoscopy is generally not recommended for routine screening at her age. 2 Another serious complication from screening tests is the risk of false-positive results.

Over the course of 10 years, one out of every three women screened for breast cancer, who do not actually have breast cancer, will have an abnormal test result that requires additional evaluation. 35 Screening tests can also lead to incorrect labeling, inconvenience, expense, and physical harm due to follow-up tests. Although there are screening tests for many different diseases and conditions, let us once again consider the case of cancer. The word “cancer” is an extremely loaded term, fraught with automatic connotations and emotional responses. Many patients have described situations where immediately following a clinician uttering the word “cancer,” they felt that they were briskly overwhelmed and not able to pay attention to or hear anything else that was said. But many conditions that currently include the word “cancer” do not truly represent life-threatening diseases. Leaders from the National Cancer Institute have called for removing the term “cancer” (or “carcinoma”) for any lesions that do not present a reasonable likelihood of 277 lethal progression if left untreated, such as many premalignant conditions including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 36 The idea is that patients are likely to behave differently if their disease is appropriately framed with the correct implied degree of seriousness. For example, many forms of thyroid nodules and thyroid “cancer” are not truly dangerous. Since 1975, the incidence of thyroid cancer has nearly tripled, but the mortality rate has not changed. 37 These patients often undergo frequent follow-up ultrasound tests to monitor this abnormality, which is a huge source of radiology revenue, but has no demonstrated impact at all on mortality. 38,39 “The epidemiology of the increased incidence … suggests that it is not an epidemic of disease but rather an epidemic of diagnosis.” 37 Sound familiar?

This results in biases that sometimes shape recommendations. Commonly, different groups come up with directly opposing recommendations. As a general rule, the USPSTF tends to be more conservative compared to many advocacy groups. For example, in 2008 the USPSTF found that two colorectal screening tests—fecal DNA testing and CT colonography—were lacking in evidence, while the ACS endorsed these tests. 32 In 2009, the USPSTF recommended against “routine” mammography for women aged 40 to 49 years, suggesting instead that physicians first address women in this age group’s “values regarding specific benefits and harms.” This recommendation led to vocal and sharply polarized opinions in the medical literature and public press. Both sides flung allegations of harming women. 41 No doubt, the stakes are high. As each guideline organization evaluated the same evidence through their own lenses, different recommendations emerged. Currently, “guidelines issued by four highly respected organizations provide conflicting recommendations about the appropriate interval for screening mammography of women aged 40 to 74 years at average risk of breast cancer.” 42 USPSTF recommends mammography every 2 years for women at average risk aged 50 to 74 years. The ACS and American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines call for annual screening mammography in average risk women aged 40 years and older—without a stop date. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends annual mammography, but hedge by stating that biennial mammography may be “more appropriate or acceptable” for some women. The costs associated with these discrepant screening strategies is enormous; the United States could likely save more than $6 billion annually on breast cancer screening if practices followed the USPSTF guidelines rather than actual practices (Figure 14-4). 43 278 Figure 14-4.

What happens if they follow the USPSTF guidelines and then a patient claims to have a delayed diagnosis of breast cancer that may have been seen a year earlier if her physician had used the ACS recommendations? This has led some to propose “safe harbor” legislation that would provide liability protection to physicians that comply with approved guidelines or protocols. 42,44 Although this may make clinicians more comfortable—and possibly more likely to adhere to guidelines in general—one study found that applying proposed “safe harbor” legislation to closed malpractice claims would have reversed the findings in the physician’s favor less than 1% of the time. 45 Despite fear and the perception of malpractice liability, clinicians are frankly extremely unlikely to be sued for following a specific guideline. By the way, for comparison sake, we will note that the United Kingdom’s breast cancer screening program recommends mammography every 3 years for women aged 50 through 70 years. 46 Political contexts The US Congress created the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR, which later became AHRQ) in 1989 and charged it with creating a public-private partnership to develop, disseminate, and 279 evaluate clinical practice guidelines. But in 1995, Congress very nearly defunded the agency in response to lobbying by back surgeons who disagreed with the guidelines the group had created for the treatment of low back pain. 47 The threat to defund the program was likely not an empty one. Other governmental bodies, such as the National Center for Health Care Technology and the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, have been defunded due to political sensitivities surrounding this type of activity. 47 In the court of public opinion, the harms of overscreening are very rarely considered. 48 The framing of these harms is controversial even among scientists, as thresholds to quantify harm from overscreening are imprecise. 49 Despite the 2009 mamm","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_15"}}],["1103",{"pageContent":"of public opinion, the harms of overscreening are very rarely considered. 48 The framing of these harms is controversial even among scientists, as thresholds to quantify harm from overscreening are imprecise. 49 Despite the 2009 mammography guideline update, it does not appear there was any subsequent decrease in utilization, suggesting a lack of public acceptance. 50 Many have noted that when considering cancer screening programs, “politics trounces science.” 51 As the issues surrounding the production of guidelines in the United States become increasingly contentious, political fights can even lead to judicial disputes. One dramatic example has been labeled “The Lyme Wars,” pitting most of American medicine and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) against a faction consisting of self-proclaimed “Lyme-literate” patients, advocates, politicians, and physicians, led by the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society, 52 who promote the idea of “chronic Lyme disease.” A number of political groups have sprouted up to purportedly increase awareness and raise funds for “chronic Lyme disease.” The Lyme Action Network widely released a patient-facing pamphlet called “It Might Be Lyme” that listed various nonspecific symptoms that may be harbingers for this disputed entity. 52 The battle became so heated that in May 2008, the attorney general of Connecticut performed an antitrust investigation into the development of Lyme disease treatment guidelines released by the IDSA, one of the largest medical societies in the United States. 53 Likely prompted by the increased scrutiny, political contexts, and high-wired reactions enveloping guidelines these days, in June 2013, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute announced that it would discontinue its nearly 4-decade participation in the development of clinical guidelines. 54 Shifting guidelines to improve value and decrease harms of overtesting A number of suggestions have been made over the last few years to reform guidelines in order to improve value and decrease harms of overtesting. One that has seemed to take hold is for recommendations to routinely be graded by a standardized rubric. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system (www.gradeworkinggroup.org) classifies recommendations as strong or weak based on the strength of the evidence and patient outcomes. 55 GRADE does not allow for “expert opinion.” In the absence of evidence, or if there is clearly conflicting evidence, no recommendation is made.

This is actually a paradigm shift, considering that more than half of guideline recommendations currently by IDSA and those issued by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology are based solely on expert opinion and do not have evidence to back them up. 56–58 Other systems for grading evidence have been developed by the USPSTF (Table 14-3) and AHRQ. 59 Table 14-3 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation grades 280 One of the problems with guidelines based on “expert opinion” is that many have expressed concerns about conflicts of interest among members of guideline groups. 47,60 According to a 2002 survey, 87% of clinical guideline authors had some form of interaction with the pharmaceutical industry—more than half had received financial support. 61 Interestingly, only 7% of participants believed that their own relationship with industry influenced their recommendations, 19% felt that their coauthors’ recommendations were influenced by such relationships. 61 The Institute of Medicine has recommended that “groups that develop clinical practice guidelines should generally exclude as panel members individuals with conflicts of interest and should not accept direct funding for clinical practice guideline development from medical product companies or company foundations.” 47 Despite the sharpening focus on healthcare value, guidelines notably often do not explicitly consider the cost denominator of the value equation at all in their analyses or recommendations. 62 This has prompted some leaders to call for more widespread inclusion of cost considerations and information in guidelines, which could help inform clinicians, the public, and policymakers regarding interventions that are most likely to provide high-value care for patients. 63 Since guidelines are complicated documents that require careful analyses and considerations that rely on a breadth of skill and knowledge, a multidisciplinary team that include expertise in epidemiology, statistics, economics, and healthcare policy should be included in effective guideline groups. 60,64 Some have also advocated for including patients and explicitly addressing patient preferences in guideline considerations. 65 Of course, creating the guidelines is only part of the issue.

For guidelines to be effective, they must convince clinicians to adhere to their recommendations in the correct situations. There are various barriers to guideline adherence, including lack of awareness, familiarity, or agreement. 66 Guideline groups and healthcare systems should concentrate on efforts to improve observance of appropriate guidelines. Some suggested 281 M strategies involve including prioritized checklists of recommendations and clear implementation strategies that rely on systems rather than individual clinicians. 64 Part of the challenge with guideline implementation is that guidelines are typically optimized for the average patient and it is widely accepted that there will always be exceptional patients that do not fit the criteria of the recommendations. The problem is that most patients view themselves as exceptional. As Yale cardiologist and health researcher Dr Harlan Krumholz eloquently puts it, “guidelines should inform but not dictate, guide but not enforce, and support but not restrict.” 67 Appropriateness criteria A new breed of guidelines is now emerging: Appropriateness Criteria. The ACR launched their ACR Appropriateness Criteria during the 1990s in an immense effort to define national guidelines for proper imaging usage. In 2013, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria addressed over 197 clinical conditions with more than 900 variants, providing expert guidance for clinicians to weigh potential benefits and risks—including radiation and costs—when choosing imaging modalities for a given clinical scenario. 68 The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are reviewed and updated at least biennially. More recently, a similar effort has emerged by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). The ACC Appropriate Use Criteria are “intended to define ‘when to do’ and ‘how often to do’ a given procedure in the context of scientific evidence, the healthcare environment, the patient’s profile and a physician’s judgement.” 69 Appropriateness Criteria often address more detailed scenarios than practice guidelines, thus are able to differentiate between subtle differences. 69 They also generally consider a much broader context that may more accurately capture possible harms of testing. Appropriateness Criteria have the potential to emerge as instrumental tools in clinicians’ efforts to deliver high-value care. Similarly, the ABIM Foundation’s Choosing Wisely campaign (www.ChoosingWisely.org) reframes the most common way guidelines are used; instead of listing guidelines for what to do, the campaign lists guidelines for what not to do.

Story From the Frontlines: “Failing Grades for Doing the Right Thing” rs Smith is a 40-year-old woman who has always had her annual pap smears. With the change in pap smear guidelines, she does not need a pap smear this year. Mrs Smith comes in for her annual well-woman visit and she expects a pap smear—she has always thought that screening for cervical cancer was very important and she is a little worried over this new recommendation and expresses this concern to her physician. So a pap smear is performed. This takes less time than counseling her about why the pap smear guidelines have changed. And it makes the patient happy because it makes her feel safe. The test shows mild dysplasia, so she returns to the office for another appointment including a colposcopy and biopsy. Mild dysplasia is confirmed on the biopsy and the patient is told that this does not need treatment, but that she should have another pap smear in six months. She is a little anxious, but relieved that this abnormality was “caught in time.” 282 So the patient had anxiety, expense, discomfort, and a couple of extra procedures over this. It turns out that she is happy that her doctor did not follow the guidelines—after all, in her view, he found something and now he will follow it closely. But … the pap smear did not need to be done in the first place, and the results of mild dysplasia are very unlikely to be significant in this case. (Most mild dysplasias resolve spontaneously without any needed treatment. Furthermore, progression from mild to cancer is very slow so progression would be discovered within the recommended interval.) As a physician, what do we have to believe in? This is just my opinion, but I think that physicians have to believe in educating their patients about why certain tests do not need to be done—I also think we have an obligation to the society as a whole to be good stewards of healthcare dollars. It does take more work to teach patients about why a test may not need to be performed—in fact it takes longer to explain this than to just do the test.

(www.costsofcare.org) PREVENTIVE SERVICES Preventive care refers to measures taken to prevent diseases from occurring. Simple examples include hand washing, smoking cessation and obesity counseling, immunizations, and exercise. As discussed in Chapter 1, Americans commonly lack adequate preventive care. 70 Remember that one of the reasons is that it is estimated it would take a primary care provider 21 hours per day just to provide all of the care recommended to meet their patients’ acute, preventive, and chronic disease management needs. 71 Missed prevention opportunities result in many downstream diseases that are costly both in physical and fiscal terms. Thirty-eight percent of all deaths in the United States are attributable to four behaviors— smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and problem drinking. 72,73 There are many preventive measures and treatments that have been proven to be cost-effective, and many that have not (Table 14-4). Some measures such as childhood immunizations and smoking cessation have convincingly been shown to not only be “cost-effective” but cost-saving. 73,74 It is estimated that up to $55 billion of annual wasted healthcare spending is due to missed prevention opportunities. 73,75 Table 14-4 Cost-effectiveness of selected clinical preventative measures and treatments 283 Many tools exist to help clinicians determine appropriate preventive services for their patients: • AHRQ provides a tool for clinicians (the Electronic Preventive Services Selector [ePSS]) to search for USPSTF graded recommendations: www.epss.ahrq.gov/PDA • Vaccine recommendations are available via the CDC: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/Schedulers/adultscheduler.html TOWARD HIGH-VALUE SCREENING, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, AND PREVENTIVE CARE Screening and diagnostic tests are important in the provision","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_20"}}],["1108",{"pageContent":"are available via the CDC: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/Schedulers/adultscheduler.html TOWARD HIGH-VALUE SCREENING, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, AND PREVENTIVE CARE Screening and diagnostic tests are important in the provision of high-value care because these tests result in many physical and financial costs for patients. The ACP has identified a number of clinical situations in which a test does not reflect high-value care, and have suggested principles for the “appropriate use of screening and diagnostic tests to foster high-value, cost-conscious care.” 76 Diagnostic tests should not be performed if the results will not change management. 76 Sounds simple enough, but this guiding principle seems to often be ignored in clinical practice. Healthcare professionals should also recognize that when the pretest probability of disease is low, the likelihood of a false-positive test result is higher than the likelihood of a true-positive result. Remember the example of CA-125 screening for ovarian cancer (Figure 14-1), where despite the test having very high sensitivity, in patients with a low pretest probability it is nearly certain that a positive result will represent a false-positive—one that can cause incredible amounts of worry and distress—rather than true disease. 284 As emphasized throughout this chapter, clinicians and patients should always consider the potential downstream costs that may be incurred if a test is performed. These costs can include profound monetary, physical, emotional, and psychosocial effects. Geriatricians have recommended incorporating lag time to benefit into prevention decisions for older adults. 77 Lag time to benefit is the length of time between a preventive intervention and the time when improved health outcomes are seen. As opposed to only asking, “how much will this test or treatment likely help?” lag time to benefit also addresses “when will it help?” This second question is at least as important as the first for older adults. If an older adult is expected to likely die before the time that any benefit from the intervention will be realized, then administering that intervention exposes them to the immediate risks without providing any upside. 77 A general approach suggested by UCSF geriatrician Dr Sei J. Lee and colleagues involves estimating the patient’s life expectancy (online calculators can be used, such as www.eprognosis.ucsf.edu), and then estimating the preventive intervention’s lag time to benefit to determine the most appropriate strategy (Figure 14-5). 77 The lag time to benefit is available for some widely used screening procedures or primary","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_21"}}],["1109",{"pageContent":"www.eprognosis.ucsf.edu), and then estimating the preventive intervention’s lag time to benefit to determine the most appropriate strategy (Figure 14-5). 77 The lag time to benefit is available for some widely used screening procedures or primary prevention treatments. If unavailable, the lag time to benefit can be estimated by reviewing Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the intervention and control groups; the point at which the curves last separate provides a qualitative estimate of the lag time to benefit. Figure 14-5. Incorporating lag time to benefit in preventive measures for older adults. (Figure created based on framework from Lee SJ, Leipzig RM, Walter LC. JAMA 2013;310(24):2609-2610.) “Incorporating time lag estimates into screening guidelines would encourage a more explicit consideration 285 of the risks and benefits of screening for breast and colorectal cancer.” 1 This time lag concept can also be important in reviewing medication lists in the elderly and minimizing unnecessary pills that are unlikely to significantly help during their lifetime, but could contribute to adverse side effects or medication interactions (see Chapter 13). In addition, UCSF geriatricians Drs Louise Walters and Kenneth Covinsky have proposed a framework for incorporating individualized decision making into cancer screening recommendations in the elderly. 78 They advocate for more informed cancer screening decisions by “detailing the benefits and harms that need to be weighed when making screening decisions. Patient preferences then act like a moveable fulcrum of a scale to shift the magnitude of the harms or benefits that are needed to tip the decision toward a screening option.” 78 In fact, clear communication between medical staff and patients improves appropriate screening by reducing underuse, overuse, and misuse. 79 For instance, a simple decision aid for mammography screening of women 75 years and older improved women’s decision making about this study. 80 However, there are many important barriers to this strategy, including a reimbursement system that makes it easier to just order a test than to have a detailed conversation with patients (see Chapters 10, 12, and 15), and quality metric programs that only focus on screening rates rather than “appropriateness.” Despite these obstacles, it is incredibly important to consider the potential risks and benefits, as well as the patient’s overall goals of care, to avoid a patient preference misdiagnosis. 81 Currently, the USPSTF (http://www.uspreventiveservicest","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 14 - Screening and Prevention - Balancing Benefits with Harms and Costs_22"}}],["1110",{"pageContent":"is incredibly important to consider the potential risks and benefits, as well as the patient’s overall goals of care, to avoid a patient preference misdiagnosis. 81 Currently, the USPSTF (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org) offers several “how to talk to patients” guides, ranging from recommendations on how to stop cancer screening in an elderly population to how to tailor screening to individuals when evidence is insufficient. Bottom line: Clinicians should carefully weigh all potential benefits, risks, and costs of interventions and discuss these openly and honestly with patients, creating an alliance that allows for real shared decision making (see also Chapter 12). To achieve this, clinicians need to have a firm grasp of how to evaluate and interpret test characteristics, and should have a clear understanding of their individual patients’ values and interests. KEY POINTS: • Screening tests aim to detect asymptomatic and early stage disease in an accurate and cost-effective manner. This goal must be balanced with the known harms associated with screening, including falsepositives, overdiagnosis, and accruing downstream costs (both physical and fiscal) for patients. • Clinicians should understand basic test characteristics and limitations, as well as their individual patient’s goals and values, prior to recommending a screening test. • Clinical guidelines are important resources for clinicians, but must be critically interpreted based on the level of evidence and consideration of possible limitations. Many new Appropriateness Criteria guidelines are emerging to help clinicians address both overuse and underuse of specific tools. • It is important to consider lag time to benefit and overall prognosis of elderly patients when deciding on potential screening, diagnostic, or treatment recommendations. 286 References: 1.

At 53-years-old, she has lived with asthma her entire life. Scented perfumes and other “triggers” can suddenly cause her airways to spasm, sending her into a fit of wheezing. Today, she is not entirely sure what set of her symptoms, but she could feel her chest tightening up as it became more and more dif icult to catch her breath, a sensation that she has experienced many times before. She reached into her purse to take out her inhaler and took a few puf s. She still felt like she was trying to breathe through a snorkel to get the air down to her lungs. Realizing that she may need help, she asked her son to drive her to a nearby urgent care clinic. At the urgent care clinic, Ms Chen is evaluated by a physician, given a breathing treatment, and undergoes an electrocardiogram (EKG). Following the breathing treatment, she continues to have significant wheezing and shortness of breath, so the urgent care clinic physician coordinates for an ambulance to take her to an emergency room across town. Ms Chen has had to visit the ER for her asthma before, but it has been a number of years since the last episode that was this bad. In the ER, she is promptly placed in a room and evaluated by an emergency medicine physician. Ms Chen undergoes further breathing treatments. A chest x-ray is taken, blood is drawn for labs, and another EKG done. Her labs are ok, her chest x-ray is clear, and her EKG remains normal. The physician then decides to obtain a chest CT (computed tomography) scan “just to be sure nothing was missed.” The CT scan does not reveal any significant abnormalities. Following more breathing treatments and an intravenous administration of solumedrol (a steroid), she improves. She ultimately is discharged home with self-care instructions, including directions for using her home inhalers and a prescription for oral steroids. In Ms Chen’s mind, this entire shortness-of-breath experience was a single event, caused by a single disease—an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by an environmental allergen. However, the urgent clinic will bill separate fees for the physician evaluation, the breathing treatment, and the EKG.

However, the urgent clinic will bill separate fees for the physician evaluation, the breathing treatment, and the EKG. The hospital will send another bill that charges separate fees for the physician evaluation, the chest x-ray, chest CT, the intravenous steroids, the lab work, the EKG, the breathing treatments, and the radiologist’s interpretation of the imaging studies. Ms Chen will be left to navigate the complex system of healthcare costs herself. Medicine is a noble profession, built on the altruistic motivations of caretakers. But, it is hard to ignore the fact that perverse incentives that require clinicians to “do more” to get paid will predictably result in more medical care. As in Ms Chen’s case, treatments and procedures are paid for a la carte, whether or not they are actually necessary or help the patient. Ms Chen very likely did not warrant a chest CT scan for her asthma exacerbation, but the hospital will be paid for it anyway. Even if the physicians’ motivation to order the study had absolutely nothing to do with making more money for himself or his medical center, there sure were no incentives for him not to order that test, or more broadly, to consider the value of the care he was delivering. 291 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recognized this problem in their seminal “Crossing the Quality Chasm” report: “Even among health professionals motivated to provide the best care possible, the structure of the payment incentives may not facilitate the actions needed to systemically improve the quality of care, and may even prevent such actions.” 1 “We already have pay for performance,” UCSF healthcare leader Dr Robert M. Wachter has quipped. “We pay more for the performance of procedures, hospitalizations, and office visits, and so that’s precisely what medicine produces.” 2 In this chapter we discuss how different payment systems can help incentivize a necessary shift from a healthcare system that is reimbursed for volume (seeing more patients and doing more tests) to a system that is reimbursed for value (making patients better off) (Table 15-1).

The physician or hospital is paid for each office visit, hospitalization, intravenous medication, xray, EKG, or other services delivered. Under traditional FFS, individual physicians and healthcare systems are financially rewarded for providing more care, even when this care does not demonstrate actual benefit. This “you eat what you treat” system may create a perverse incentive to provide patients with unnecessary care. The FFS system may have some virtues: As Harvard Medical School economist Michael Chernew put it, “[FFS] rewards hard work and productivity and incentivizes physicians not to stint on care. It avoids placing 292 physicians at financial risk if they care for sick patients and facilitates financing systems that allow patients unconstrained choice of provider (eg, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospitals).” 3 Of course, the flipside of incentivizing physicians “not to stint on care” is that it can encourage the overuse of care, particularly without checks-and-balances to counteract this impulse. Erring on the side of overdoing it has become so ingrained in clinical practice that judiciously ordering tests and referrals is often seen as more cognitively taxing for clinicians. Moreover, there is a common perception that doing so may increase the risk of malpractice repercussions (see Chapter 10). Since FFS pays each clinician and/or health system separately, it also indirectly enables the type of fragmented and duplicative care that Ms Chen experiences. FFS alone provides no financial motivation to coordinate care, or to avoid unnecessary referrals. In addition to potentially incentivizing too much care, the actual amounts that are paid out under most American FFS systems can be highly arbitrary. Prior to 1989, reimbursements paid to clinicians for the same service varied tremendously by specialty and geographic region based on what was considered “usual, customary, and reasonable” for the local market. 4 A first step toward more value-based payments was standardizing the process for determining these amounts. The relative value unit (RVU) has now become the standard of FFS productivity and is used by many health systems to determine physician compensation. 5 As we discussed in Chapter 9, FFS payments and the RVU weighting system disadvantages more cerebral parts of care delivery such as prevention and diagnosis","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_2"}}],["1123",{"pageContent":"become the standard of FFS productivity and is used by many health systems to determine physician compensation. 5 As we discussed in Chapter 9, FFS payments and the RVU weighting system disadvantages more cerebral parts of care delivery such as prevention and diagnosis compared to more procedure-based practices.

In a classic psychology experiment in the 1970s, researchers recruited a group of preschoolers that liked to draw. 7 Some of the children were told that if they drew pictures for the study, they would be given a certificate with a gold seal and ribbon. The other children were not given any such expectation. Each child was invited to a separate room to draw for 6 minutes. Afterwards, the children that were told they would be given a reward were presented their certificate as promised. Over the next few days, the preschoolers were surreptitiously watched from behind one-way mirrors to see how much they would continue drawing on their own accord. The group of children that had expected and received a reward spent about half as much time spontaneously drawing as the other kids. Perhaps even more surprising, judges that did not know who drew which pictures independently rated the art drawn by children expecting a reward as less aesthetically pleasing. Once children expected a reward for drawing, it seems that they felt less interested in doing it “for free” and they put less effort into it. As demonstrated by this example, the interplay of intrinsic motivation (motivation that arises inside the individual) and extrinsic motivation (motivation that arises from outside of the individual) is complicated. If a student is driven to get good grades because he feels fulfilled when he turns in good work, then he seems to be responding to intrinsic motivation, even if the grades themselves represent a reinforcing extrinsic motivator. On the other hand, if he achieves good grades primarily because his parents demand that he does well and that he is accepted to a particular university, then this would be in response to extrinsic motivation. 293 Promising premise and early results The idea that health services should no longer be simply paid based on quantity, but rather should focus on quality, is logical and attractive.

Taken on the surface level, “pay for performance” (P4P) is a no-brainer. P4P is built on the simple concept of providing clinicians or health systems more money for hitting specified targets, such as achieving a certain percentage of diabetic patients in a practice that have good blood sugar control. Sounds good, right? Well, as with most things, the closer one looks, the more complicated P4P actually becomes. In other words, the devil may be in the details. 8 Studies on P4P thus far have shown inconsistent results. 9 In one notably positive study, P4P hospitals in Medicare’s Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration (HQID) had greater improvement over the first 2 years in multiple metrics of quality, including measures for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia, compared to their colleagues. 10 But, over time these gains diminished and may have completely disappeared. 9,11 And, frustratingly, risk-adjusted mortality (an important bottom-line measure of performance) between hospitals participating in the program and those that did not remained similar over the course of the first 6 years. 12 In 2011, the Cochrane group published two systematic reviews that failed to show convincing evidence that financial incentives can improve patient outcomes. 13,14 A separate systematic review published in Annals of Internal Medicine around the same time concluded, “the effect of P4P targeting individual practitioners on quality of care and outcomes remains largely uncertain.” 15 Even if it is possible that P4P may have the power to change healthcare professional behaviors, 13 many of the most visible programs implemented thus far have not translated into what we really care about: better health outcomes for our patients. Perhaps if we look across the pond we will find more encouraging results. After all, the United Kingdom introduced the Quality and Outcomes Framework—a P4P program on a grand scale—more than a decade ago, back in 2004. This program tied about a quarter of family practitioners’ income to measures of their performance. 16 With incentives that large, as you may imagine, “much changed overnight” in medical clinics in the United Kingdom. 16 Family practitioners increased nursing staffing, creating programs for chronic disease that","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_4"}}],["1125",{"pageContent":"of family practitioners’ income to measures of their performance. 16 With incentives that large, as you may imagine, “much changed overnight” in medical clinics in the United Kingdom. 16 Family practitioners increased nursing staffing, creating programs for chronic disease that were much more proactive, such as nurse-run, protocol-driven clinics for some diseases like diabetes. Many hired more administrative staff to provide rapid access to performance data. They also started using full electronic medical records, since these were required for payments to be made. The pace of improvement in the quality of care for asthma and diabetes picked up considerably. 17 It seemed that the program had kick-started the engine of improvement and may have created an inflection point in the quality of care. Then by 2007, the rate of improvement had slowed and started to level off. Even more concerning, aspects of care that were not associated with an incentive actually declined in quality for patients. 17 In one of the most encouraging study results for proponents of P4P, the introduction of a P4P program in 24 English hospitals seemed to result in improvements in risk-adjusted 30-day mortality for pneumonia, heart attacks, and heart failure over the first 18 months. 18 This was the ultimate feather in the cap of P4P, as it seemed that if implemented correctly incentives might just actually save lives after all. However, yet again, these benefits evaporated over time. During the following 2 years, the hospitals not participating in the program caught up to P4P hospitals, resulting in no measurable mortality difference any more between these groups. 19 294 Well, if incentives or “bonuses” may not reliably work, how about invoking penalties for poor outcomes? Would the natural instinct of loss aversion be more motivating to clinicians or health systems? Maybe … maybe not. Back in 2008, Medicare introduced a policy that reduced payments for hospital-acquired infections. 20 Some states responded to this no-pay-for-poor-performance measure aggressively and slashed hospitalacquired infection rates. 21 But a 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that overall the policy had no measurable effect on the rates of central catheter-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections across US hospitals. 22 Taken together, it appears that P4P programs are helpful in catalyzing, but not sustaining, meaningful change.

It is clear that at the very least P4P is not a “magic bullet” and if it is to improve care, payment reforms must be paired with sustainable reforms in care delivery. 16 Moreover, even if we believe there should be some incentives for quality, determining appropriate metrics and fair schema is not straightforward. Concerns and challenges Is it a motivation problem, in the first place? “The quality improvement literature has pinpointed many causes of quality breeches in medical care: fatigue; poorly designed workflow and care systems; undue commercial influence; knowledge gaps; memory lapses; reliance on inappropriate heuristics; poor interpersonal skills and insufficient teamwork, to name just a few,” wrote health policy expert, Dr Steffie Woolhandler, and behavioral economist, Dan Ariely. 23 “But ‘not trying’ is rarely cited. Yet P4P implicitly blames lack of motivation for poor quality care.” The current healthcare system is built on the backs of hardworking, well-intentioned health professionals. It does seem hard to argue that dangling some more dollars on a string would somehow get them to try even harder. But much as was seen following the introduction of the UK program, it is possible that the potential power of P4P is not in trying to drive personal motivation, but rather in fomenting delivery system changes and innovations (such as the implementation of electronic health records and the creation of nurse-led chronic disease clinics). This may be even truer at the hospital or health system level. Could P4P undermine intrinsic motivation and result in negative effects? Tangible rewards, particularly monetary ones, seem to weaken, or “crowd-out,” intrinsic motivation. 24 There are many examples from the emerging behavioral economics literature. Remember how a shiny certificate had the power to possibly squash preschoolers’ inherent joy of drawing? Another frequently cited example of motivational crowd-out evaluated monetary payments for blood donors. When money was offered, blood donations actually decreased, leading many to argue that by introducing financial rewards, the stronger altruistic motivations of the donors were being replaced by the weaker monetary one. 24,25 The intuition here is that many people donate blood because it is socially recognized as “the right thing to do.” Fewer people decide to donate blood because it is a desirable way to make money.

Some physicians fear that measuring and rewarding physicians may similarly sap motivation. 26,27 Still, not all rewards are bad all the time, particularly when there are multiple competing motivations. “For instance, when the Italian government gave blood donors paid time off work, donations increased. The law removed an obstacle to altruism.” 24 295 So, it seems the salient question then is whether or not the volume-based payment system is currently “an obstacle to altruism,” and does P4P help remove this barrier? What is the correct amount of money in P4P bonuses and penalties? The United Kingdom has provided up to a quarter of potential income in their initial schema, but most P4P programs in the United States have used much smaller incentives. One of the leading concerns has been that large financial incentives would induce efforts to “game the system.” Even without overt misplay, substantial incentives could cause harm by creating undue focus on the limited areas of clinical practice that are being measured and incentivized. Due to these concerns, a change in the income structure that would reduce the percentage tied to P4P in the United Kingdom “has been widely welcomed.” 16 On the other side of the spectrum, incentives that are too small may not even garner physicians’ attention. In a national survey performed in 2008, one-in-six physicians did not even know whether P4P was incorporated in their compensation or not. 28 Of course, it is hard for financial incentives to promote change if physicians are not even aware of their existence nor how it is that they get paid. The challenge is finding the amount of incentive that is large enough to invoke change, but not so lucrative as to create a singular focus. The other issue is whether to pay for meeting a set standard goal or for relative improvement. In one early natural experiment, physician groups whose performance was initially lowest improved the most following the introduction of P4P, whereas physician groups that were already performing above the bonus threshold at baseline improved the least—yet, those that were above the bonus threshold at baseline captured threequarters of the bonus payments. 29 Therefore, the way the incentive is structured is important since it could potentially lead to the greatest improvers not being rewarded, while also","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_7"}}],["1128",{"pageContent":"the least—yet, those that were above the bonus threshold at baseline captured threequarters of the bonus payments. 29 Therefore, the way the incentive is structured is important since it could potentially lead to the greatest improvers not being rewarded, while also possibly allowing good performers to rest on their laurels rather than create further improvements. Moreover, if the lowest performers who have the greatest potential for clinical benefits from improvements are penalized for not hitting a specific target despite making incremental changes, then it could further denigrate their ability to improve. Do we even know how to accurately measure quality or value? Not everything important can be measured and not everything measured is important. Large parts of clinical practice just cannot be accurately computed or benchmarked, leaving quality metrics to be made up of only those things that can be rather easily quantified. Even more concerning, there is some evidence that quality may deteriorate for non-incentivized measures like continuity of care. 30 Thus, rewarding a narrow set of indicators could in fact decrease overall global quality. This may be “the medical equivalent of teaching to the test.” 31 As we begin to focus on value, the problem becomes even more acute. Remember from Chapters 4 and 10 that there are numerous complications with defining and measuring value. In addition, there are also serious concerns about the validity of the current data and the problem of accurate attribution to specific practices. Based on a study analyzing nearly 1.8 million Medicare claims in 2000 through 2002, patients saw a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists working in four different practices. 32 Only about a third of the visits each year were with a patient’s assigned physician, and a third of patients changed their assigned physician from one year to another. The unfortunate reality is “the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), despite heroic efforts, cannot accurately measure any physician’s overall value, now or in the foreseeable future.” 33 296 What are the potential “side effects” of P4P? Even if P4P is relatively new in the world of medicine, it is not a new concept. Perhaps the first real experiment of P4P was in the mid-1800s in England. British schools and teachers were paid on the basis of the results of student examinations, with the goal of improving educational outcomes.

What happened, though, is curricula narrowed to only focus on the tests, and teachers quickly figured out that the way to get students to perform well was via rote memorization of test specifics. Soon enough, “testing bureaucracy had burgeoned, cheating and cramming flourished, and public opposition had grown dramatically.” 34 In the United States, attempts at performance-based pay for schools in the 1960s similarly resulted in cheating scandals and failures. 34 These days, merit pay remains a very controversial topic in education. As we can see, there are many possible “side effects” of P4P that need to be considered. For example, clinicians motivated to meet specific goals may practice “cherry picking” by attempting to preferentially see and treat patients that are already the healthiest. In the 1980s, pediatric residents that were paid for each clinic visit saw more patients, and their patients had fewer visits to the emergency department, compared to their colleagues that were “salaried.” 35 But as it turned out, almost all of the differences were because the residents that were paid for each clinic visit enrolled more healthy patients and performed many more well child visits, thus had “stacked the deck” in their favor. P4P programs can also create a tunnel vision focus on only things that are measured. For instance, an emergency department may concentrate on processes related to pneumonia care since these will be measured and reported, while not necessarily pay attention to the quality of care for patients with other critical ailments, such as gastrointestinal bleeds. Another possible unintended effect is the creation of a “check-the-box” mentality that meets measures but does not actually improve care. With the introduction of quality measures, standard forms that include checkboxes are naturally created to “capture” these processes, but this can encourage people to “just check the box” and say that they did something like smoking cessation if they met some minimum requirement, even if they did not really provide substantive counseling. Creating financial incentives: general recommendations Financial incentives, when designed and used properly, can be a motivational tool to help drive behavior. It is important that the incentives align well with the shared purpose of the organization and clinician, and thereby avoid the problem of motivational crowd-out.

In the Geisinger Health System in Pennyslvania, physician incentives are designed to reward teamwork and collaboration. For example, endocrinologists’ goals are based on good control of glucose levels for all diabetic patients in the system, not just those they see. 36 Moreover, a collaborative approach is encouraged by bringing clinicians together across disciplinary service lines to plan, budget, and evaluate one another’s performance. These efforts are partly credited with a 43% reduction in hospitalized days and $100 per member per month in savings among diabetic patients. 37 At UCSF, even a modest financial incentive (of up to $1200 per year) offered to residents and fellows has proven effective. Specific quality improvement project goals are determined collaboratively between the trainees and medical center leadership. 38 The engagement of UCSF frontline physicians in defining their own annual goals and in leading the intervention programs helps 297 ensure dedicated buy-in and loyalty to the program (see also Chapter 16). Healthcare leaders, Drs Thomas Lee (Harvard and now also Chief Medical Officer at Press Ganey) and Delos “Toby” Cosgrove (Chief Executive Officer and President at Cleveland Clinic), have made a number of recommendations for creating incentives that lead to sustainable changes in care delivery 36 : • Avoid attaching large sums to any single target. Much like with the local UCSF program, small incentives that are well applied tend to catch clinicians’ attention and drive change. Theoretically, intrinsic motivation is engaged whenever one “measures” quality and reports it, thus even without paying, no one wants to be at the bottom. Even on the health system level, incentives that target only 1% of Medicare payments, which itself is only a fraction of overall reimbursement, have driven national efforts to reduce readmissions. 39 • Watch for conflicts of interest. Financial incentives that are focused solely on reducing costs, rather than improving quality or patient safety, can create real or perceived conflicts of interest. Doctors should not stand to gain by shortchanging patients. In addition, “‘Gain sharing’ programs, in which the organization shares with physicians the savings from improved performance, have not been successful at most hospitals, in part because of their complexity.” 36 This does not mean that aligning incentives to support the reduction of unnecessary care will necessarily cause harm to patients by promoting","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_10"}}],["1131",{"pageContent":"organization shares with physicians the savings from improved performance, have not been successful at most hospitals, in part because of their complexity.” 36 This does not mean that aligning incentives to support the reduction of unnecessary care will necessarily cause harm to patients by promoting doctors to withhold care. Dr Lee noted in a separate article that “…my years of experience as a physician leader of a large health care system with many large capitated contracts suggests that physicians simply will not withhold care that they believe patients need, even if the costs of that care hurt them financially. They will be upset as they contemplate the fiscal impact of needed care, but they will not withhold it.” 40 Regardless, it appears unwise to create incentives that may create apparent conflicts of interest or could reasonably lead to clinician resentment. • Reward collaboration. Good healthcare requires the dedicated effort of many different individuals working together. “Physicians (like most people) naturally prefer that their compensation be based on behaviors that they alone control, such as whether they order tests in specific circumstances—but that approach does not encourage teamwork.” 36 It seems more effective to create goals that depend on collaboration across individuals and departments. It is likely that the endocrinologists at Geisinger may have opted for the metric to be based solely on diabetic patients that they see themselves, but by making them responsible for glucose control across the organization they now are encouraged to think about larger system changes and to work with other departments and clinicians. Let us not forget that the overall goal of these incentives is better care for as many patients as possible. • Communicate. Financial incentive programs should be continually appraised and modified. It is vital clinicians participate in this process and that the goals and shared purpose of the program are clearly communicated. When appropriate extrinsic motivators align or interact synergistically with intrinsic motivation, it can 298 promote high levels of performance and satisfaction. 41 We believe that it is important to engage frontline clinicians in the creation and design of financial incentives that will affect them. To best appeal to clinicians’ intrinsic motivation, it seems that P4P measures should be developed in consultation with clinicians and based on meaningful, clearly communicated goals for improving patient care. 26 MOVING FROM VOLUME TO VALUE “Perhaps the only health policy issue on which Republicans and Democrats agree is the need to move from volume-based to value-based payment for healthcare providers,” wrote health policy experts Drs Robert Berenson (the Urban Institute) and Deborah Kaye (Johns Hopkins) in","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_11"}}],["1132",{"pageContent":"health policy issue on which Republicans and Democrats agree is the need to move from volume-based to value-based payment for healthcare providers,” wrote health policy experts Drs Robert Berenson (the Urban Institute) and Deborah Kaye (Johns Hopkins) in 2013. 33 The Affordable Care Act (ACA) strives to encourage healthcare value by simultaneously improving quality of care and driving down unsustainable healthcare costs. These goals are enacted through a variety of Medicare “purchasing” strategies that include global, population-based payments to accountable care organizations (ACOs); bundled payments for high cost, high variation services and procedures like hipreplacement; a value-based purchasing (VBP) program for all hospitals paid by Medicare; and a physician value-based payment modifier (PVBPM) for individual physician services. These programs are intended to encourage physicians to work with their peers, systems, hospitals, other professionals, and their patients to hit quality targets while optimizing resource use. 42 Clearly there is an expectation that clinicians shoulder responsibility to develop and support strategies for mitigating inappropriate resource use. Public reporting of quality and cost Starting in 1991, the New York State Department of Health began publicly reporting risk-adjusted mortality rates for patients that underwent heart bypass surgery. This initially led to intense media attention and scrutiny for the lowest performers. Many hospitals were prompted to improve their cardiac surgery programs, and statewide mortality fell substantially as a result. 43 In addition, surgeons with the highest mortality rates were much more likely to retire or leave their practices. 43,44 Differences between hospitals still remained though. In fact, patients that picked a top-performing hospital or surgeon had approximately half the chance of dying as did those who picked a hospital or surgeon from the bottom part of the list. 44 Nevertheless, market share did not seem to change based on performance. 44 The other critical issue was that as surgeons became increasingly concerned about their performance scores, they began turning away the sickest patients, thus exacerbating racial and ethnic disparities. 45 As this example highlights, public performance reporting seems to generate behavioral changes in both individual clinicians and health organizations, generally improving quality of care, albeit not without some unintended consequences. 45,46 This is despite the fact that patients and families do not seem to be paying much attention to public reporting and there is little actual impact by these programs on the selection of healthcare providers. 46 In an effort to empower the public with information on quality and costs, 47 CMS has freely released","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_12"}}],["1133",{"pageContent":"families do not seem to be paying much attention to public reporting and there is little actual impact by these programs on the selection of healthcare providers. 46 In an effort to empower the public with information on quality and costs, 47 CMS has freely released a treasure trove of accessible data at www.data.medicare.gov. This website includes the public-facing resource “Hospital Compare” (www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov), which features easily searchable results comparing hospitals across a variety of metrics, including patient experience; readmissions, complications, and deaths; use 299 of medical imaging; and Medicare payments. Now within minutes, the public can find out how a specific hospital, by name, compares to state and national averages across an array of domains. Notably for the discussion of value, this includes markers of overuse, such as the percentage of “outpatients with low back pain who had an MRI without trying recommended treatments first, such as physical therapy,” along with the explanation, “if a number is high, it may mean the facility is doing too many unnecessary MRIs for low back pain.” 48 CMS will soon provide individual and group physician-level performance scores through their Physician Compare program (www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare). 49,50 Indeed, the “wall obscuring physician performance difference” is finally starting to crumble. 50 The effect of this more extensive and transparent public reporting program is yet to be seen. Medicare’s value-based purchasing program Despite some of the criticisms and concerns regarding P4P, in 2012 the federal government introduced their VBP program, which is basically a P4P system for all hospitals paid by Medicare. In effect, the ACA required that 1% of Medicare hospital payments be dispersed based on “value,” under the Medicare VBP Program. This incentive amount will gradually rise to 2% in 2017. Once again, this is likely an important shift in the right direction of paying for good healthcare rather than just more healthcare, although it does come with all of the baggage of the disappointing previous results of P4P. The seemingly marginal amount of reimbursement currently linked to value (1%-2%) has been sufficient in getting the attention of most medical centers, given the substantial proportion of revenue that comes from Medicare payments.

Opponents are concerned that unintended consequences may include practitioners or health systems avoiding sicker and/or poorer and/or minority patients. These concerns have largely failed to be substantiated, and in fact there is suggestion that P4P may work particularly well for hospitals that serve poor patients. 51 There remains, however, concerns about not rewarding relative improvement, which, as discussed above, could result in the lowest performing hospitals having further resources taken away and possibly creating a vicious cycle that impedes development. The physician value-based payment modifier Medicare’s PVBPM applies to individual physicians and physician groups still in traditional FFS Medicare— the lion’s share of physicians. For groups as small as 10, it ties payment updates to performance on composite measures of quality and resource use. The reward formula is simple. Performance is assessed in two dimensions (quality and cost), with physicians that perform above average in both dimensions receiving payments, those that are worse than average or choose not to participate will be paid less, and physicians with average performance will see no change. 42 300 In 2014, CMS sent Quality and Resource Use reports to show physicians how their performance on the measures to be used in the PVBPM compares to peers. Eligible physicians will now receive an annual report of their performance on cost and quality measures. 52 Beginning in 2015, quality reporting will transition from a voluntary program to a mandatory one—the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (“PQRI”)—which will require that by 2017 all physicians report on quality measures applicable to their practice. 53 To facilitate reporting, CMS aims to consolidate efforts for a number of programs so that physicians can report once and qualify for the physician quality and reporting system incentive program, the meaningful use requirements, and the value modifier. 52 If physicians elect to not participate, their Medicare payments will be reduced by 1.5% beginning in 2015 and the reductions will continue to increase thereafter. 53 Bundled and global payments A way to potentially drive more","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_14"}}],["1135",{"pageContent":"modifier. 52 If physicians elect to not participate, their Medicare payments will be reduced by 1.5% beginning in 2015 and the reductions will continue to increase thereafter. 53 Bundled and global payments A way to potentially drive more thoughtful resource utilization that does not reward unnecessary care or complications is through prospective or bundled payment systems. Among the calls for payment reform to hospitals and physicians, most suggest some form of bundled payments to physicians, with specific approaches ranging in scope. If we consider reimbursements to a hospital, rather than paying a discrete fee for each service rendered (FFS), the payer may instead pay a specific amount for each day in the hospital (per diem), for each episode of hospitalization (eg, diagnosis related groups [DRGs]), for each patient in their community considered to be under their care (capitation), or the hospital could be given a fixed fee for all services performed on every patient during a full year (global budget) (Table 15-2). Table 15-2 Common payment methods 301 For example, a hospital could be paid one fee for childbirth, regardless of how the baby is delivered and the number and type of interventions or resources used. Bundled payments could theoretically encourage reductions in hospital-acquired complications as these would lead to increased costs, length of stay, and spent resources. Global or bundle payments could also potentially combine payments across different providers and settings (Figure 15-1). In our opening vignette, Ms Chen’s insurance was billed separately from the urgent care clinic and the emergency department, with itemized charges for each service rendered. However, under a bundled payment structure, this single episode of asthma exacerbation would result in a single payment that would be shared across the two settings and providers. This is meant to incentivize the creation of coordinated care systems that work together and share information. 302 Figure 15-1. Fee-for-service versus global payments. Let us consider a second example. If Mr Adams, a 65-year-old man, suffers a heart attack, his care associated with this medical event may span multiple different healthcare settings and providers. He could be seen in an emergency department, be hospitalized under the care of a hospitalist physician, undergo a procedure by a cardiologist, work with physical therapy, be discharged to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility, and see his primary care physician for a post-discharge follow-up appointment.

If all of these entities are paid a single fee for the treatment of Mr Adams’ heart attack, it will benefit these providers and systems if they all work together to take care of Mr Adams. Also, any unnecessary testing or procedures will come out of the group’s bottom line. Evidence is accruing to support what seems like an obvious conclusion: delivery system integration can improve care and decrease spending for patients, particularly when there is a strong emphasis on primary care and when healthcare providers accept greater financial risks for the outcomes of their care. 54 Risk sharing and shared savings force health systems to have “skin in the game.” One early and successful example is the Blue Cross Blue Shield “Alternative Quality Contract” in Massachusetts, which began in 2009. 55 Providers were contracted under a fixed global payment level for a period of 5 years (plus inflation), with expanding margin opportunities linked to performance on quality (Figure 15-2). This meant their growth in revenue was tied to value. It also meant that any savings from eliminating wasteful care were theirs to keep. Interestingly, the early results of this program showed cost savings not only for Blue Cross Blue Shield patients but also for Medicare patients seen by the same providers, suggesting a significant spill-over 303 effect from these types of efforts. 56 Indeed, as the Washington Post headline discussing this finding proclaimed, these types of coordinated care savings “may be contagious.” 57 Similar value-based insurance designs (VBID) are becoming increasingly common. The University of Michigan Center for Value-Based Insurance Design maintains a registry of innovative VBID programs at various stages of development all over the country (http://vbidregistry.org/).

They are really a hybrid of the more traditional FFS system and true capitation. According to CMS: “ACOs are groups of doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers, who come together voluntarily to give coordinated high quality care to their Medicare patients. The goal of coordinated care is to ensure that patients, especially the chronically ill, get the right care at the right time, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors.” 58 When an ACO delivers high-value care by accomplishing both high quality and low costs, then it shares in the savings that it achieves. Two initial Medicare models of shared savings were designed. In one model, healthcare systems are eligible to share in savings but do not bear any risk for losses during the first 2 years. These ACOs are eligible for approximately 50% of savings accrued by the Medicare program after they surpass a fixed savings threshold. 304 The second model involves healthcare organizations taking both upside and downside risk sharing from the start. These organizations are eligible for a larger percentage of shared savings. This model more closely approximates capitation. Similar private insurance ACO models have also emerged, with multiple insurance plans entering into contracts with providers using a shared risk payment model, making providers eligible for both bonuses and financial penalties. 59 Some of the early results of the ACOs have been optimistic, showing gains in healthcare quality 60 and possible slowing of associated healthcare cost growth, 61 but it is important to keep in mind the sober words of former CMS administrator Dr Don Berwick that ACOs are a “promise, not a panacea.” 62 “[ACO’s] logic is strong: offer primary care physicians and group practices shared savings and risk in an environment that also gives them the flexibility to place resources where patients need them, rather than dancing to the fee-for-service tune,” wrote Dr Berwick in 2012. 62 “As they learn how to coordinate care and anticipate needs, costs should decline further for the right reason, because patients get better care.” Still, not everyone holds such a rosy view of ACOs. Voicing concerns about “echoing” the HMO “managed care fiasco,” some warn that perhaps what is even worse than FFS is “fee-for-non-service.” 31 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) The CMS Innovation Center was created by the ACA in 2010, and tasked with testing payment and","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 15 - Shifting Incentives - Moving Reimbursement from Volume to Value_17"}}],["1138",{"pageContent":"that perhaps what is even worse than FFS is “fee-for-non-service.” 31 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) The CMS Innovation Center was created by the ACA in 2010, and tasked with testing payment and delivery system models that could improve the quality of care and simultaneously slow the rate of cost growth for Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 63 Promising models can be expanded nationwide by the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as long as the model either reduces spending without reducing the quality of care, or improves the quality of care without increasing spending—in other words, improving “value.” 64 This program is meant to “overcome antireform inertia” by allowing the diffusion of successful programs without requiring congressional approval. 65 The Innovation Center is currently focused on the following priorities 64 : • Testing new payment and service delivery models • Evaluating results and advancing best practices • Engaging a broad range of stakeholders to develop additional models for testing The innovation models include ACOs, bundled payments for care improvement, primary care transformation (particularly patient-centered medical homes—see Chapter 9), and initiatives to speed the adoption of best practices. CMS has also contracted with expert groups to develop and test different payment model strategies, utilizing simulations of the impact of these models. 66 The aim of the Innovation Center is to catalyze swift evolution of programs by performing rapid-cycle iterative evaluations that help strengthen implementation. 67 TRANSITIONING FROM FEE-FOR-SERVICE TO VALUE-BASED PAYMENTS In 2013, a group known as Catalyst for Payment Reform created a national scorecard on payment reform. 68 Their initial survey showed that only about 11% of healthcare dollars paid to doctors and hospitals were tied to “value-oriented” measures, with the other 89% represented by traditional FFS payments. 68 The evolution 305 I may have begun, but there is a long way to go before medical payments in the United States are truly based on value rather than volume.

For clinicians to take on these risks, it will be essential that change is incremental. Moreover, clinicians will need to be supported in the transition to models that focus more on longitudinal care, coordination across domains, and responsibility for population health. If the payment system is to meaningfully shift, then the delivery system will need to adapt simultaneously. It is important to understand that payment reform is not an either/or proposition but instead a continuum of financial risk. There are a spectrum of options between volume and value (Figure 15-3). As clinicians assume increasing levels of risk for a larger portion of total care, the incentives are greater not only for efficiency and coordination, but also for “stinting on care.” 70 Some hope that safeguards can be put in place, such as publicly reported quality metrics that include measures of underuse, which will allow for more ambitious forms of capitation to be successful without the threat of encouraging the withholding of necessary care. 70 Figure 15-3.

Now that I work on healthcare issues as a patient safety advocate, I am more aware of overuse and the costs associated with it. More care does not mean better care and it is depleting our healthcare resources. My estimate for all of the items listed is at least $15,000—and it actually was probably more. Luckily, my out-of-pocket costs were insignificant since my copays have always been very small. The point of my story is that the outcome, my passed tiny kidney stone, would have been the same if I had paid $0, instead of generating all of these costs.

(www.costsofcare.org) CONCLUSION Healthcare is financed in the United States through a complicated, byzantine system that has slowly developed and evolved over the course of decades to center primarily around employment-based insurance that reimburses providers on an FFS structure (see Chapter 2). The path has been laid out, however, to begin to transform this arrangement to one that will reflect an emphasis on value and quality. While the details and effects surrounding financial incentives for motivating change are controversial, it seems critical that we at least stop disincentivizing the delivery of appropriate care. In a transformed medical system, clinicians should no longer be financially punished for providing care that does not translate into a specific “Current Procedural Terminology” (CPT) code (see discussion of RVUs and the Relative Value Unit Committee in Chapter 9).

Keeping patients healthy requires care that often centers on noninvasive therapies. If we are to expect clinicians to take the time to appropriately counsel patients about the risks and benefits of undergoing a screening procedure (see Chapter 14), or to undertake true shared-decision making related to complex medical choices (see Chapter 12), or to discuss the best and most cost-effective individualized medication prescriptions (see Chapter 13), then it will be critical that there is some sort of compensation for these cognitive tasks. Whether or not it makes sense to provide specific financial incentives for “value-based care,” the system needs to be calibrated so that the financial mechanics align with intended goals and 307 outcomes. Clinicians are driven by intrinsic motivation and professionalism, but we should no longer counteract that impulse with financial incentives that run explicitly counter to care that may be best for patients. “Payment reform should focus not on manipulating greed, but on dampening it,” suggests Drs David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler. 31 “Then the real motivations for good doctoring—altruism, social duty, and the glow we feel when we help our patients—can flourish.” KEY POINTS: • The majority of healthcare payments in the United States are currently based on a fee-for-service (FFS) system, which results in separate fees paid for each distinct service rendered. Although there are some advantages for patients and clinicians to this system, FFS promotes (or at least does not discourage) the overuse of healthcare resources, by focusing solely on volume rather than value of services. • Pay-for-performance (P4P) programs provide financial incentives, or bonuses, for meeting certain quality targets. Despite high face validity of this strategy, the results of these programs have been mixed thus far and there is a dearth of evidence that P4P actually improves patient outcomes. • Financial incentives, when designed and used properly, can be a motivational tool to help drive behavior, but it is important that the incentives align well with the shared purpose of the organization and clinician. • The Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted a variety of Medicare “purchasing” strategies that include a value-based purchasing (VBP) program for all hospitals paid by Medicare and a physician value-based payment modifier (PVBPM) for individual physician services.

Ignaz Semmelweis worked as a house of icer in an obstetrical ward in Vienna, Austria, where nearly one-in-six woman died following childbirth. In the other obstetrical clinic he worked in, the maternal mortality rate was less than half that, at 7%. He began to wonder why there was such a discrepancy in the outcomes between these two clinics. Ignaz noticed that doctors and medical students at the first clinic were often coming directly to the delivery room after performing autopsies, even frequently with a “disagreeable odor” on their hands. He began to hypothesize that there may be “cadaverous particles” that could be transmitted by the hands of these physicians resulting in harm for birthing mothers. He recommended hands be scrubbed in a chlorinated lime solution before every patient contact. Of course, we all know what happened. Hand-washing resulted in the mortality rate in the obstetrical ward to plummet to less than 3%. 1 The experience of Ignaz Semmelweis and others across the globe around that time showed convincingly that hand-washing could dramatically save lives. So, naturally every clinician immediately began washing his or her hands prior to every patient contact, right? Well, incredibly this is not what happened. Over the next 150 years there was slow incremental progress in achieving universal hand-washing practices. It turns out that changing behaviors, especially in the traditions of medicine, is very challenging. Even when there is a mortality benefit, the availability of convincing evidence is generally not enough to ensure widespread changes. Only recently have hand-washing practices improved substantially in most medical centers. This has been achieved through multidimensional strategies that connect available evidence with accountability, such as flagging nosocomial infections and providing 360-degree feedback, as well as with systems that address barriers to hand-washing, such as removing the need for a sink by strategically placing alcohol-based handrubs in clinical areas. As we have stated previously, “When it comes to reducing healthcare waste, we may still be in the equivalent of the mid-1800s; we have convincingly identified the problem and some are now shouting from the mountaintops for change.

But much like hand-washing, we may need to do a better job thinking about how to make it easier to do the right thing.” 2 Drawing on the lessons of hand-washing, our Costs of Care group has created a “COST” framework for designing multidimensional strategies to prevent harms from overuse: culture, oversight accountability, system support, and training. We introduced this framework in Chapter 11 in the context of educational efforts to teach value, but just as that discussion focused mostly on experiential learning and culture change, this structure also applies directly to implementation efforts. We believe that effective efforts need to target all four of these “COST” areas (Table 16-1 includes a worksheet that can be used for designing interventions). Table 16-1 COST framework for high-value care interventions 313 This chapter will focus on the need for healthcare systems to operationalize the ideas behind value improvement into practice. We will consider how organizations can best support the efforts of frontline clinicians in creating change, highlighting some recent clinician-led efforts. We will also touch upon the translation of models from other industries to improve healthcare reliability and efficiency, such as the recent application of Lean management strategies to healthcare organizations. IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE TO TRANSLATE EVIDENCE INTO PRACTICE Clinical research has led to remarkable medical breakthroughs that have saved and enriched countless lives. However, as discussed throughout this book, the delivery of such effective healthcare is extraordinarily uneven, leading to unconscionable disparities that result in some patients being given too little effective care whilst others receive too much—both situations creating unnecessary harm. 3 For us to realize the fruits of our research advancements, the uptake of the most reliable medical evidence will need to be enhanced. This requires strengthening the connections between the insights from science to the efficient delivery of evidencebased medicine, ultimately leading to better outcomes and superior patient experience (see Figure 4.5, page 88). Remember from Chapter 10 that the use of aspirin by patients who have previously had a stroke greatly reduces the chances that they will have another stroke, 4 yet barely more than half of eligible patients are given aspirin. 3 While the pharmaceutical industry invested piles of money to create more efficacious medications such as clopidogrel (Plavix), much greater benefit may actually be gained by creating delivery systems","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_1"}}],["1152",{"pageContent":"barely more than half of eligible patients are given aspirin. 3 While the pharmaceutical industry invested piles of money to create more efficacious medications such as clopidogrel (Plavix), much greater benefit may actually be gained by creating delivery systems that 314 more reliably support patients taking aspirin after a stroke. 5 In other words, we need to not only study and understand biology and medical therapeutics, but also how to best deliver healthcare. The National Institute of Health (NIH) has recently recognized this gap and created a research agenda that focuses on advancing the “knowledge base related to disseminating and implementing evidence-based health strategies in real-world settings.” 6 An entire multidisciplinary field of study in “implementation science” has now emerged, defining general design principles that include (1) application of individual and organizational behavior change theories, (2) identification and engagement of key stakeholders, and (3) commitment to rapid-cycle improvement with collaborative, bidirectional relationships between the intervention sponsor and the behavior change target. 7 The success of implementation of a given target practice or system depends on a number of external and internal factors. People and systems must be prepared for change, and have the capacity for implementation. 8 Even if every single resident physician agreed that having in-depth goals of care discussions was a worthy and important goal for a defined group of hospitalized patients, if the residents are already working at the 80- hour-per-week limit there may not be any capacity to add yet another process to their work day. In another example, when promoting a project to decrease transfusion rates in our hospital, I (CM) presented to our internal medicine resident physicians the evidence that supports a “restrictive” transfusion strategy. Following the educational session, many of the residents assured me they would change their practices and would encourage their colleagues and teams to do the same. These residents had the authority and leeway to make this change. But when I gave nearly the same presentation to a group of neurosurgical residents, who were very engaged and supportive, a hand went up from one of the residents at the table: “This is great and I believe in the evidence here that you provide,” she said. “But unless you get my surgical attending to explicitly change what they want me to do, there is no way that I will be able to do anything about this.” Heads across the room were shaking in agreement.

Once again, it is not enough merely to know what the right thing to do is, we must identify and tackle barriers to these practices, including factors that may be seen as predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing to the current and desired behaviors. 9 Just as the saying goes, “all politics is local,” the same is often true when addressing barriers to implementation. While educational outreach—matched with appropriate enabling and reinforcing strategies—may be effective for internal medicine residents to change their transfusion practices, this may not be adequate for surgical residents even within the same institution. The “PRECEDE” model (“predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling constructs in educational diagnosis and evaluation”) provides an example framework for thinking through the design of initial implementation strategies (Figure 16-1). 10 When planning a program to improve hand hygiene behaviors, the current leadership environment and personal beliefs related to infection control are predisposing factors that should be carefully considered and addressed. 315 Figure 16-1.

By the way, what we did for our transfusion reduction project following our meeting with the neurosurgical residents was we focused on identifying local champions. We presented the information to the attending surgeons and recruited a bunch of prominent, well-respected surgeons from our institution to pose for a picture with a statement saying they supported the project. We hung this poster up prominently on the surgical ward. This helped the residents feel supported and enabled them to be more willing to follow the transfusion guidelines.

Engaging frontline clinicians “If improvement is the plan, then we own the plan,” said the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Dr Donald Berwick in 2011. 11 “Government cannot do it. Payers cannot do it. Regulators cannot do it. Only the people who give the care can improve the care.” So how do healthcare organizations best engage clinicians in improving the care they provide? For starters, as we discussed in Chapter 15, it is important that extrinsic incentives are well aligned with clinicians’ internal motivations to provide the best possible care to their patients. The finest way to achieve 316 this is to create a noble shared purpose. Clinicians nearly universally enter the medical profession with honorable ambitions to serve their patients. When the goals of an organization truly and explicitly align with this intention—rather than perhaps merely paying lip service in a mission statement—then it is more likely that clinicians will feel eager about pitching in to work toward that ideal. Currently, clinicians may be confronted with institutional oversight on whether their documentation maximizes billing, clinical “report cards” that focus on productivity or throughput, and quality indicators that are driven by national mandates such as indiscriminately reducing readmission rates, to name a few. When this is what floods clinicians’ inboxes, the unintended message from the healthcare system is that these are the things that truly matter. Furthermore, clinicians may sense the tectonic plates beneath their feet shifting in response to various national reform efforts, creating an unstable environment that does not necessarily compel intrinsic motivations to improve care. “To help physicians move beyond grief and anger about what they might be losing as the healthcare system remodels, leaders must shift the conversation to something different—something positive, noble, and important,” recommend health leaders Drs Thomas Lee and Toby Cosgrove. 12 “They must articulate a vision of what lies on the other side of the turmoil ahead: healthcare that will be better—maybe even great—for patients. Improved patient care has to form the core of any change agenda that clinicians will embrace.” By laying out the hope ahead for the profession, we are more likely to generate an organic will for change. The importance of key institutional leadership and role modeling cannot be stressed enough.

An aligned mission empowers junior staff to pursue improvements in care delivery with a crisp overarching goal: make care better for our patients. Another vital tool for creating behavior change is appropriately leveraging opinion leaders and peer pressure. Local opinion leaders can have profound impacts on the practices of their colleagues, oftentimes proving more effective at garnering changes in physician behavior than other tried-and-true methods. In one classic randomized trial at community hospitals in the early 1990s, some obstetricians obtained education from local opinion leaders about reducing cesarean section (c-section) rates, while others were given only audit and feedback. 13 The opinion leader education dramatically increased guideline-concordant care for trial of labor—resulting in significantly higher vaginal birth rates. The simple audit and feedback generated no measurable effect. Thinking again about hand-washing, I know if I were to be seen entering a patient room without washing my hands by one of my colleagues, I would feel genuinely embarrassed. Do we feel embarrassed if our colleague sees us order an unnecessary test or procedure? Perhaps not yet. When used correctly, peer pressure can be a powerful motivator for behavior change. On an operational scale, sharing ratings or metrics internally and/or publically can generate perceived peer pressure and can drive behaviors. 14 Humans—and particularly physicians—are naturally competitive and will often respond to metrics that show them to be not performing as well as others. Thus, combining audit and feedback with role modeling from opinion leaders, creating suitable peer pressure, can be a potent strategy for inspiring change. Audit and feedback appear to be most effective when 15 : • Baseline performance is poor, thus providing a lot of opportunity for change. • The person providing the feedback is a supervisor or colleague. 317 • The feedback is provided more than once. • The feedback is given both verbally and in writing. • And the program includes clear targets with an action plan. Although the engagement of frontline health workers is essential for improvement efforts, system changes nearly always require actions from management. Clinicians need the necessary tools to effectively study and design projects. 16 And many clinicians will need appropriate time and resources to stimulate and support proposed initiatives. Organizations can strategically invest in providing protected time to some individuals on the frontlines.

The idea was to create a model for translating the impetus behind initiatives such as the ABIM Foundation’s “Choosing Wisely” campaign 18 into robust implementation strategies at the health system delivery level. 318 Figure 16-2. Caring Wisely at UCSF. The underlying realization for this program was that top-down decrees for specific changes often did not align well with the interests or motivations of on-the-ground healthcare workers. A platform that could “pull” ideas and enthusiasm from the frontlines (rather than simply “pushing” programs out)—while simultaneously providing a bridge to institutional leadership and resources—may be more potent at generating behavior changes. In an effort to provide a concrete example of this type of program, we will describe some of the details of how Caring Wisely works. Phase I: Engage frontline staff to identify “hot spots” The annual Caring Wisely campaign begins with an “ideas contest,” a search for compelling ideas to identify key areas (“hot spots”) for improving inefficiencies and reducing costs within the UCSF Health System. The announcement e-mail is sent by our chief medical officer to all employees of the UCSF Health System, implicitly displaying the buy-in from high-level hospital management to folks on the ground. Ideas are submitted by employees at all levels, including unit clerks, nurses, physicians, administrators, and researchers. Participants can submit an idea even if he or she does not intend to submit a proposal for implementation. Next, a selection committee that includes administrators, staff, and clinicians from each site reviews and ranks all ideas, choosing the top 5 to 10 ideas. Criteria for selecting winning Phase I ideas include: • Must be safe, and not cause harm, reduce quality, or adversely affect the patient experience.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_6"}}],["1157",{"pageContent":"and clinicians from each site reviews and ranks all ideas, choosing the top 5 to 10 ideas.

Idea winners are announced in a system-wide e-mail and receive a modest gift card to their choice of a local fine dining establishment. Phase II: Engage frontline staff to create implementation plans Next, the Caring Wisely team sends out a call for proposals from the UCSF community, specifically highlighting the “hot spots” identified by the ideas contest. Proposals are collected via the UCSF Open Proposals system: a Web-based platform enabling transparent and collaborative proposal development. Up to $50,000 funding is provided by the UCSF Health System and is offered for each chosen proposal. The Open Proposals system provides an iterative process that allows stakeholders to review proposals and provides the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, leave comments, or offer suggestions. This also fosters real-time multidisciplinary team building. Additionally, teams can promote their proposals and build further support from their community, with some teams encouraging their colleagues to go review their proposals and provide “likes” (similar to the like button on popular social media site, Facebook) to display support. The review committee of Caring Wisely leadership and stakeholders evaluates proposals based upon a project’s potential to: 319 • Measurably reduce costs from the perspective of the delivery system. (Should show potential savings of more than $200,000 within first year.) • Ensure health outcomes are maintained or improved. • Have demonstrated commitment and engagement of clinical leadership and frontline staff. • Have potential to scale. Two to three proposals were chosen during each of the first two rounds for funding and implementation. Phase III: Support and build implementation Chosen projects are funded for a one-year implementation phase and implementation is supported by the robust Caring Wisely program, which provides infrastructure support including delivery system leaders, the institutional finance team, and experts in implementation science.

The partnership between project teams and the Caring Wisely team is a critical component of the program. The Caring Wisely team offers a director, program manager, data analysts, and implementation scientists to support project teams and to ensure institutional learning as the program matures. Work-in-progress meetings are held with project teams and the Caring Wisely team every 2 weeks to support progress, troubleshoot issues, and foster collaborative learning between project teams. This ongoing support provides the frontline clinicians leading the efforts with the requisite expertise and institutional support to help generate successful implementation. Geisinger’s ProvenCare and other efforts to create continuous system-wide improvement In 2006, Geisinger—a nonprofit, integrated health services organization serving over 2.5 million residents in central and northeastern Pennsylvania—did something that is generally unheard of in medicine. They made a “guarantee.” Christening the program as “ProvenCare,” Geisenger brought together their heart surgeons to review all class I and IIa recommendations—those recommendations that have the highest level of supporting evidence—from the 2004 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guidelines for CABG surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or “bypass surgery”), and to translate these recommendations into 40 verifiable behaviors. 19 They then assembled a multidisciplinary team to “hardwire” these best practices into everyday workflow, and to implement a robust program of real-time data collection and feedback. 19,20 So far, so good, sounds like many other quality improvement or clinical pathway initiatives. But, what Geisinger did was perhaps revolutionary: they guaranteed that all 40 benchmarks would be achieved for every patient that underwent elective CABG surgery within their health system—and they put their money where their mouth is. 21 They packaged all preoperative, inpatient, and postoperative care within 90 days into a single fixed price. If a patient suffered a postoperative complication, there would not be any additional charges from any Geisinger facilities. This part of the program is basically a provider-driven enactment of bundled payments (see Chapter 15). The New York Times famously referred to this as “surgery with a warranty.” 22 Taking responsibility for things that happen within 90 days of surgery—even when patients are no longer within a medical facility—requires not only care coordination and careful attention to quality practices, but also trust that patients will do their","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_8"}}],["1159",{"pageContent":"urgery with a warranty.” 22 Taking responsibility for things that happen within 90 days of surgery—even when patients are no longer within a medical facility—requires not only care coordination and careful attention to quality practices, but also trust that patients will do their part. As part of the initial ProvenCare program, a Patient Compact was developed to highlight the importance of patient activation in their own healthcare (see Chapter 12). 19 At the outset of the program, less than 60% of patients at Geisinger received all 40 best practice 320 components, but shortly following implementation this rose to 100% and appeared to be sustained. 19 Nowadays, if any of the preoperative benchmarks have not been performed, surgery is delayed until this unfinished task is completed. 21 The benefits of performing these benchmarks were immediately obvious, with length of stay decreasing 16% and mean hospital charges falling more than 5% over the first year. 19 Operative mortality has also been declining. Leaders of the program have concluded that “frontline medical care providers, led by process design specialists, can successfully redesign episodic processes to consistently deliver evidence-based medicine, which may improve patient outcomes and reduce resource use.” 20 The ProvenCare model has now been expanded to other clinical areas, such as perinatal care, 23 and has even spread to include multiple institutions through a collaborative program to improve care for lung cancer patients. 24 There are a handful of other well-known beacons for system-wide continuous improvement. In 2009, Intermountain Healthcare in Utah was highlighted by President Obama as a model for high-quality care at lower costs. 25 Applying evidence-based protocols and practice improvement methodologies to more than 60 clinical processes, Intermountain has now reengineered roughly 80% of all care that they deliver. 26 Intermountain has also actively addressed supply chain inefficiencies and resource utilization, cutting costs and ensuring that they are providing the best evidence-based tools and supplies to their providers and patients. 26 Over in Ohio, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital has partnered with local physicians to create large-scale improvements in certain clinical areas, such as children with asthma, resulting in 92% adherence to best practices for asthma care, which has yielded many avoided hospital admissions and emergency department visits. 27 Cleveland Clinic, already renowned for state-of-the-art cardiac care, has recently risen as a leader in integrating team-based approaches and shared decision making, with an overarching focus","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_9"}}],["1160",{"pageContent":"asthma care, which has yielded many avoided hospital admissions and emergency department visits. 27 Cleveland Clinic, already renowned for state-of-the-art cardiac care, has recently risen as a leader in integrating team-based approaches and shared decision making, with an overarching focus on enhancing patient experience. 28 Kaiser Permanente, based in California, is a massive integrated health system that has achieved a number of high-quality clinical indicators at low costs, primarily through coordinated efforts to provide population management to their large patient base. 29 For example, a blood pressure program by Kaiser involved a comprehensive hypertension registry, the sharing of performance metrics, the integration of evidence-based guidelines, the development of medical assistant visits for blood pressure management, and the promotion of single-pill combination pharmacotherapy, achieving hypertension control in more than 80% of their patients identified with high blood pressure. 30 Kaiser Permanente has been so successful that it now serves as a model for national health programs in various countries around the world. 29,31,32 Many other examples of impressive healthcare system innovations exist. Later in this chapter, we will discuss how some institutions like Virginia Mason and Denver Health have successfully adopted Lean manufacturing methodologies to systematically cut waste. We will also outline the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM’s) recommended strategies for creating “continuously learning healthcare systems.” 33 Centers and collaboratives for shared learning and organizational benchmarking In 2008, the ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value was founded in Appleton, Wisconsin, as a “small nonprofit with a big mission the help change the healthcare industry.” 34 The ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value provides a number of educational services and programs, partnering with health 321 A organizations to explore ways to improve quality and drive down costs in healthcare. Part of the program is dedicated to integrating Lean strategies (see below) within healthcare organizations to systematically root out waste and improve processes. A number of academic health centers have also recently developed new institutes aimed at promoting innovation and value. 35 UCSF has established a Center for Healthcare Value to promote solutions for value throughout delivery systems, research, policy, and clinical training. 36 George Washington University opened an Office for Clinical Practice Innovation in 2013 with “the mission of engaging and educating faculty, fellows, residents, and students in clinical practice innovation,” centering around new ways to deliver care that enhance value. 35 In 2010, four leading health systems (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Denver Health","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_10"}}],["1161",{"pageContent":"and educating faculty, fellows, residents, and students in clinical practice innovation,” centering around new ways to deliver care that enhance value. 35 In 2010, four leading health systems (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Denver Health, Intermountain Healthcare, Mayo Clinic) and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice formed the High Value Health Care Collaborative. 37 The core asset of the group is to provide a data trust with a number of supportive “marts” that are customized for specific purposes and easy analyses. The hope is to ultimately stimulate the identification and widespread adoption of best-practice care models. In 2014, the consortium included 19 healthcare delivery systems. Story From the Frontlines: “Teaching Value—Arizona” little friendly competition is a good thing. We have seen it work in our residency programs. That is why we answered the “Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely Challenge” (see Chapter 11) with a competition of our own. Unfortunately, it is not hard to find the waste and low value care in most hospitals. We reasoned that the best ideas to promote and teach high-value care would come right from our own residents and fellows. Our hospital, Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, is among the largest teaching hospitals in the Southwest and a major teaching affiliate of the University of Arizona College of Medicine—Phoenix, where we are both faculty. Banner Health is among the more innovative health systems in the country and has jumped in with both feet to the “high-value” movement. Banner has incorporated high-value care into its major strategic objectives and is one of Medicare’s Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations. It is not enough to just provide more care. We have to provide high-value care: better quality at less cost. Our contest was designed to educate house staff in high-value care, improve patient care, develop future leaders in healthcare, engage house staff in quality improvement activities, and disseminate findings to improve care throughout the system and beyond. We challenged residents and fellows in our graduate medical education programs to enter our “highvalue care” contest.

We thought including our system leaders as judges would be a great way to engage these leaders with our training programs and innovative efforts to improve care. The final projects were as wide-ranging in their approach as they were high quality. The final projects included ideas to decrease admissions in cirrhosis, address end-of-life decision making, minimize imaging for duodenal tubes in the ICU, and increase the use of probiotics, to name a few. The winning ideas from residents in our orthopedic, family medicine, and internal medicine programs were: • Attempted reduction of unnecessary diagnostic testing by utilization of cost transparency. • An evidence-based approach to reducing the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. • Implementation of a hospital-wide system to increase the appropriate use of cardiac stress testing. Now the hard work really begins for these winners. They have already assembled their multidisciplinary teams and received guidance from leaders in our system. These three presented their high-value project final results in May 2014 at our “Graduate Medical Education Quality and Safety Day” with a chance to win another $2500. Our “high-value care” challenge at Banner Good Samaritan is off to a great start. We have had great support from hospital and system leadership, the program directors and faculty, and the medical staff.

Brown. “Teaching Value—Arizona.” Costs of Care, 2014. (www.costsofcare.org) APPLYING TOOLS FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES TO HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS Oftentimes when entering an airplane I think, “Thank God this plane is not a hospital.” The airline industry has achieved an astonishing safety record, making the drive to an airport much more dangerous than flying 30,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean. When travelling by plane, I can be quite confident that I will arrive in my predetermined destination, safe, and likely at—or reasonably near—my estimated arrival time. And when it comes to costs, despite gripes about airlines now charging fees for various services such as transporting luggage, the price of air travel has remained quite stable over the years; in fact, after adjusting for inflation and 323 adding in baggage and change fees, domestic airfares (excluding taxes) are 39% lower in 2013 than they were in 1980. 38 If only healthcare was as reliable and stable. Surely, you recall the infamous estimate by the IOM that medical errors result in the equivalent of a “jumbo jet crash each day.” 39 None of us would feel nearly as comfortable entering a 747 if we knew that one would drop out of the sky every day. Considering this, it seems logical that the healthcare system could learn much from the airline industry. While this is clearly true, it is worth mentioning that healthcare is exceptional for a number of obvious and not-so-obvious reasons. Not least of all, when a plane crashes, the pilot is just as likely as the passengers to die, which clearly is not the case for a surgeon or physician treating a patient. Notwithstanding the best intentions in the world, it is inherently a different situation when one’s own life is on the line. From an industry perspective, major aviation errors are immediately broadcast to the public with substantial financial and reputational ramifications. And even as airplanes become increasingly sophisticated and complex, the human body is many magnitudes more intricate and enigmatic. Aviation also has relatively few airlines and a single authoritative federal regulator. 40 Despite these notable differences, many key principles of patient safety have been adapted from aviation, including teamwork training based on Crew Resource Management concepts, 41 nonpunitive reporting of errors, 42 and a focus on a “safety climate” or culture. 43 High reliability organizations","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_13"}}],["1164",{"pageContent":"key principles of patient safety have been adapted from aviation, including teamwork training based on Crew Resource Management concepts, 41 nonpunitive reporting of errors, 42 and a focus on a “safety climate” or culture. 43 High reliability organizations—organizations or systems that operate in hazardous conditions but have fewer than their fair share of adverse events, such as aviation and nuclear power plants 44—offer critical insights for enhancing the safety and dependability of healthcare. Thus, similarly, when it comes to considering efficiency and costs, it may make sense to look toward other industries outside of healthcare, particularly manufacturing. In the city of Toyota, Japan, precise machines work side-by-side with people to build millions of vehicles each year. In 2012, Toyota sold about 9.75 million vehicles, making it the top auto manufacturer in the world. 45 Producing that many vehicles requires extreme efficiency. But, of course, to maintain a respectable reputation and to continue to sell so many cars, quality and safety is paramount. On a Toyota production line, if anything goes wrong, any member on the factory floor has the ability to “stop the line.” This applies to the machines as well; if equipment malfunction or a defective part is discovered, affected machines automatically stop, allowing operators to correct the problem before it progresses through production. This practice of “jidoka” (“which can be loosely translated as ‘automation with a human touch’” 46 ) permits Toyota to apply their concept of “Just-in-Time” manufacturing, in which each process produces only what is needed by the next process in a continuous flow. 46 Since the principles and methods of the Toyota Production System focus on improving quality while reducing waste, they have been generically referred to as “Lean.” The five general principles of Lean are to define value from the customer’s perspective, identify the value stream and remove any waste, make value flow without interruption, help customers pull value, and pursue perfection. 17 Lean identifies three main categories of operational waste 17 : • Muda: Anything that does not add value for the customer. • Muri: Overburden, which occurs when one asks an individual, a piece of equipment, or a system to do that which it is not capable of doing. • Mura: Unevenness.

This concept is meant to focus attention on creating smooth and harmonious flow 324 through processes. The application of Lean management principles in healthcare If it is not always entirely clear how efficiency better serves our patients, then perhaps we can turn to the “Father of Modern Medicine,” Sir William Osler, who is quoted as stating in 1893, “Medical care must be provided with the utmost efficiency. To do less is a disservice to those we treat, and an injustice to those we might have treated.” Likewise, the leaders of Toyota have reportedly said, “Waste is disrespectful to humanity because it squanders scarce resources. Waste is disrespectful to individuals because it asks them to do work with no value.” Dr Patricia Gabow, the chief executive officer at Denver Health, adds, “In healthcare… waste is disrespectful to our patients because it asks them to endure processes with no value.” 47 Since the philosophy of Lean is built on respect for people and continuous improvement, it translates incredibly well to healthcare. In fact, Lean has been increasingly adopted by medical centers across the country as a systematic approach for improving quality and efficiency. 48 Perhaps the most prominent trailblazer in this movement has been Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle. Back in 2000, Dr Gary Kaplan became the CEO of Virginia Mason and, at that time, his board of directors challenged him by asking, “Who is your customer?” When he responded with a knee-jerk response, “our patient,” he said the board did not accept it at face value. “We began to do a deep dive on our processes and came to realize that they were designed around us, the doctors, the nurses, the people working in the organization as opposed to our patients,” Dr Kaplan explained. 49 “It all began with a desire to explore the redesign of processes around patients rather than caregivers.” So Virginia Mason began to look around for a better management system, but Dr Kaplan did not find any shining examples in American healthcare. “That is when we almost serendipitously discovered that Boeing just down the street was 7 to 8 years along in deploying the Toyota Production System,” he said. “When we realized that Boeing was able to reduce the lead time to construct the 737 airplane from 22 days to 11 days, and in so doing build a safer aircraft at less costs, we said wow, this might have applications","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_15"}}],["1166",{"pageContent":"said. “When we realized that Boeing was able to reduce the lead time to construct the 737 airplane from 22 days to 11 days, and in so doing build a safer aircraft at less costs, we said wow, this might have applications for healthcare.” 49 So, in 2002, some of the leadership of Virginia Mason took their first trip to Japan to study “The Toyota Way.” The trip was monumental for the future of Virginia Mason, which has led the way for integrating Lean methodologies to cut waste and improve healthcare, and has now become an exemplar for quality healthcare delivery. Now all leaders at Virginia Mason attend mandatory leadership training, are required to lead formal improvement events each year, and are expected to coach and train staff in the use of production system tools and methods. 50 One of the fundamental concepts of Lean is to go to where the actual work is done and observe firsthand the processes and how things work. 48 A representational flowchart called a current-state value stream map can be created to depict all of the individual steps in a process from beginning to end, providing a graphical tool for identifying and categorizing waste in the process, which include any non-value-added steps, delays, waiting times, and inefficiencies. 48 To ensure this current state is accurate, the honest insights and input from those that actually do the work in the process is required. With a current-state value stream map in hand, an experienced improvement team can systematically brainstorm potential solutions to identified issues, 325 eventually devising a future-state value stream map that represents an improved and streamlined way to accomplish the processes. Another key component of Lean is a commitment to rapid improvement cycles. 17,48 The goal is to quickly perform “small tests of change” and then to iterate and hone these changes until they neatly fit the needed improvement. Once a possible solution has been identified and needs detailed development and testing, a kaizen event—an intensive focused multiday effort—may be held. 17 Virginia Mason Medical Center says they conduct literally hundreds of these workshops annually. 17 A resident physician that took part in a week-long kaizen event as part of a quality improvement elective told me (CM) that he felt it was the most useful handson training in how to understand the inner workings of the hospital that he ever experienced.

He noted that residents may have difficulty designing and implementing traditional quality improvement projects, due to a general lack of dedicated time and rotations that often do not provide longitudinal follow-through, but a dedicated event that lasts a few days to a week may be more easily carved out of their schedule and can provide an immersive experience. This is likely also true for many other frontline clinicians and healthcare staff. Early success stories of Lean programs are emerging from different corners of the country. The application of Lean methodologies to a Joint Replacement Program at a Veteran’s Affairs hospital cut length of stay for patients from about 5½ days to 3½ days 51—just think, that is, two fewer nights sleeping in those uncomfortable hospital beds and being woken up during the middle of the night to have vitals checked! At the University of Michigan only about half of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs)—a long intravenous (IV) line that is inserted in the arm and terminates just above the heart—were not placed on the day they were requested. These delays resulted in postponed delivery of important medications and late discharges from the hospital. With the introduction of Lean production methods, now 90% to 95% of PICC lines are inserted within 24-hours of the request. 48 And at Virginia Mason there is a laundry list of metrics showing success. For example, the Virginia Mason Production System has freed an estimated 25,000 square feet of space by using better space designs, has reduced the time it takes to report lab results to patients by more than 85%, and reduced labor expenses in overtime and temporary labor by $500,000 in just one year. 50 Denver Health has proven that Lean can be applied even in a resource-strapped safety net institution that includes an educational mission with medical students and resident physicians. Following the introduction of Lean, Denver Health achieved remarkable successes, resulting in more than $170 million in financial benefits, while simultaneously increasing their patient satisfaction ranking by almost 50 percentage points. 28 FOMENTING CHANGE FROM WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS Although many of the programs described above involve devoted institutional leadership and big-scale systemic transformations, there is an important role to be played by individual clinicians to work toward value improvement, and perhaps to even inspire bigger change within","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_17"}}],["1168",{"pageContent":"CHANGE FROM WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS Although many of the programs described above involve devoted institutional leadership and big-scale systemic transformations, there is an important role to be played by individual clinicians to work toward value improvement, and perhaps to even inspire bigger change within their own healthcare system. Clinicians generally “have the requisite drive, experience, and context to be productive innovators.” 16 But obviously it takes more than drive and experience. Clinician innovators also need to possess some fundamental tools for innovation, such as an understanding of a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle and how to create “SMART” (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound) goals and project charters, which are described in further 326 detail below. Basic improvement tools W. Edwards Deming—an American engineer, statistician, and professor that has become known as the “Father of the Science of Quality Improvement”—popularized the PDSA cycle that is widely used in business and medicine for the continuous improvement of processes (Figure 16-3). 52 The PDSA cycle is described as “the scientific method adapted for action-oriented learning.” 53 The steps are simple: PLAN, or design, the experiment; DO the experiment; STUDY the results, outcomes, and unexpected problems; and ACT on the results by integrating learning generated throughout the process to make adjustments. The cycle is based on continuous improvement, which is why these steps are proposed to continue on ad infinitum, always leading to new insights and advancements. Figure 16-3. Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle for improvement. But to even get started on the cycle, we need to first have a good plan. There are many different methods for recognizing a good target area for improving healthcare value. The first may be to simply reflect on personal anecdotal experiences—what things have you seen done or have you done yourself that you think might not make sense? Or, maybe there are areas of obvious variation within your own system. These practices may be easiest to identify and could be specific to your own environment. Does it seem like your hospital always orders carotid ultrasounds for patients admitted with syncope? 54 Does one of the attending physicians in clinic always recommend antibiotics for sinusitis, whereas the other one does not? These simple observations can be great for generating hypotheses to investigate.

These simple observations can be great for generating hypotheses to investigate. However, it is important to not base decisions on anecdotes, so once an area catches your interest, the next step is to collect the data and see if this is really a widespread problem warranting an intervention. Beside personal observations, another resource for generating potential practices to target are the ABIM Foundation’s Choosing Wisely lists (www.choosingwisely.org). Once again though, it is critical that we use data to investigate whether or not the area highlighted by a Choosing Wisely list or guideline is actually applicable to local practices. Sometimes investigating cost or utilization data can highlight outliers and identify potential areas of interest. In reviewing financial data at UCSF, the Division of Hospital Medicine discovered that they spent more than $1 million annually in direct costs for the administration of “nebs” (aerosolized breathing treatments) to patients admitted to the hospital on the medical service. An investigation found that they could be providing inhaler treatments for patients at a lower cost while having the benefit of teaching patients how 327 to properly use their inhalers. 55 Still, not every area of high cost is a good target for intervention. For example, the use of recombinant factor VIII also cost more than $1 million per year at UCSF, but this was appropriately used for patients with hemophilia and appeared to be a necessary expenditure. 56 Project ideas may be generated by many other mechanisms as well, including literature reviews, case reports, or national initiatives. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“the CDC”) has recommended that every healthcare setting implement an “antimicrobial stewardship” program. 57 If your practice setting does not include such a program then this could be a great goal. Once an area for value improvement is identified, the next step is to create a clear aim statement. A good aim statement may follow the “SMART” criteria. 58 Say you want to decrease unnecessary blood transfusions in your hospital and that you have obtained baseline data confirming variation in practices and providing evidence of excess transfusions in some situations at your institution. A statement that claims your project aims to “reduce blood transfusions in our hospital” may capture the overall impetus but it is not very “SMART.” How will you accomplish this goal?

How will anyone know if you succeeded in meeting your goals? “By providing education, audit, and feedback, and creating a best practice alert in our electronic health record, we will reduce blood transfusions for all patients admitted on the orthopedic service by at least 25% over the next six months.” This statement is specific, provides actionable items, is reasonably attainable (based on analysis of the baseline practices), is relevant, and includes a clear timeline. The project team will also need to develop an overall measurement strategy. Consider using a balanced set of measures for all improvement efforts: structure, process, outcomes, and balancing measures. 59 As described in Chapter 4, process measures may be thought about as “what health professionals do to people,” whereas outcome measures are “what happens to people.” 60 • Structure measures: The material, human, and organizational resources available in the settings in which care is delivered. 59 The number of MRI machines, hospital beds, and available staff may be important structural aspects to consider and measure. If a project seeks to deliver influenza vaccines to all eligible patients, then the number of nursing full time equivalents (FTE) required to deliver influenza vaccines could be a structural measure. • Process measures: What is actually done in giving and receiving care? For a process measure to be valid, it must previously have been demonstrated to produce a better outcome. 61 For example, whether or not a patient is given an influenza vaccine during a hospitalization could be considered a process measure. • Outcomes measures: The effects of care on the health status of patients and populations. 61 If fewer people die after receiving influenza vaccines, then this mortality benefit would be an outcome measure. Outcomes can be expressed as “the five Ds”: death, disease, discomfort, disability, and dissatisfaction. 62 • Balancing measures: Ensures that changes do not result in other unintended problems. For example, if efforts to discharge patients before noon actually resulted in increased length of stay because some patients were being kept until the next day to be discharged in the morning, this would be an important balancing measure that may not be captured if one is only measuring the percentage of patients discharged prior to noon.

Figure 16-4 includes a Project Charter template that could be used or adapted by project teams during the early stages of project development. Figure 16-4. Sample project charter template. (Reproduced, with permission, from The UCSF High-Value Care Committee.) Leveraging cost and quality data Clinicians should know the basic lay of the land for what kind of data is available in their health system and where to look to obtain this data (Table 16-2). Analyzing healthcare data, and particularly cost data, often requires specific expertise and it is important to obtain the support of quality improvement, business, financial, and resource managers. Traditionally, costs are accounted for at a relatively high level, and are not routinely allocated to specific clinical processes. In Chapter 4 we describe a cost accounting method called time-driven activity-based costing that requires clinicians and financial managers to work together in order to understand how costs accrue in real time as patients receive care. Table 16-2 Finding data in your hospital 329 330 It is worth noting that cost reduction efforts in particular often require a certain level of diplomacy. Since a large proportion of healthcare costs go to labor, efforts to reduce cost may lead to cuts in the resources available to certain departments, or to individuals’ wages. An initiative aimed at reducing inappropriate diagnostic imaging 63 could directly result in decreased revenue for the radiology department, which is partially paid based on volume of studies performed. Therefore, careful stakeholder recruitment is critical to successful value improvement initiatives. The support of senior leaders can make all the difference in negotiating these delicate situations. 56 It is also often possible to find improvement opportunities that are financially beneficial to both patients and the radiology department (or another facet of the institution)—particularly for low-value clinical decisions where the institutional costs exceed the revenue. For example many ultrasounds that are ordered in pregnancy for “follow-up” testing do not inform patient care and the costs far exceed the Medicare reimbursement rates.

At the same time, freeing up ultrasound machines or other forms of “excess capacity” can provide opportunities for higher value applications of institutional resources. By carefully measuring the costs of clinical processes, taking a diplomatic approach, and reapplying excess capacities, the University of Utah Health System was able to save $2.5 million in 2012 alone. 64 Ready for implementation and dissemination Once teams have trialed their improvement ideas through small tests of change and have a high degree of confidence that the changes are indeed an improvement, they are ready to progress to the “implementing and sustaining changes” phase. During this phase, change ideas are formally implemented into everyday practice in 331 the unit or department where the work is done. Consider: Do you have the buy-in and commitment from your stakeholders? Is there a high-degree of belief that your change will lead to improvement? If so, you are ready to implement! Do not forget to consider all four areas of the “COST” framework: • Culture change: How will you encourage a shift in the culture or the “hidden curriculum” that will support your project goals? • Oversight: How will you most effectively provide audit and feedback or other methods for appropriate oversight? • Systems changes: What changes to workflows or systems can you feasibly make that will make it easy for your target audience to do the right thing? • Training/Education: Will your change require ongoing education? When new staff enter the world of your change, will they be ready to adopt your desired behavior? There are many great resources for clinicians that want to learn more about the basic science and tools of improvement, including the free IHI Open School platform (http://www.ihi.org/education/ihiopenschool).

Dr Gawande goes on to describe three stages in our evolution to close the ineptitude gap: a “primitive” stage where we simply tell people “you should do X,” a “medieval” stage where we use guidelines or regulations to tell people “you must do X,” and a “modern” stage where we figure out how to make “X” the norm. Making “X” the norm is not trivial but many of the tactics we have described so far in this chapter are helpful aids in our early efforts. But to ensure that we do not remain inept in the long-term, we need to do more than implement the knowledge we currently have. We will also need healthcare systems that can adapt as we acquire new knowledge. Continuously learning healthcare systems Most health professionals are advised near the beginning of their training that being in healthcare is a commitment to lifelong education. Just as individual clinicians must continually adapt and learn to provide the best care, so do our health systems. In their report, “Best Care at Lower Costs,” the IOM put forth a number of recommendations for creating “continuously learning healthcare systems” (Box 16-1). 33 The need for largescale digital infrastructure with systems that allow for meaningful data collection and analyses is obvious. And easier said than done. As is better care coordination and continuity. However, now many different forces are 332 working to integrate care both through clinical and payment models, such as the promotion of ACOs (see Chapter 15). These integrated systems need to optimize operations to make them efficient and reliable, perhaps borrowing tools from other industries. In addition, policy initiatives that support these ideals, including aligned payment reform and performance transparency (see Chapter 15), are critical to reinforcing sustainable systems. Moving toward continuously learning healthcare systems will demand committed leadership. The executives of 11 leading healthcare delivery institutions created “A CEO Checklist for High-Value Health Care” that includes 10 key strategies based on their own experiences (Table 16-3). 26,28 Table 16-3 ACEO checklist","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 16 - Implementing Value-Based Initiatives - A New Challenge for Clinicians and Healthcare Systems_23"}}],["1174",{"pageContent":"executives of 11 leading healthcare delivery institutions created “A CEO Checklist for High-Value Health Care” that includes 10 key strategies based on their own experiences (Table 16-3). 26,28 Table 16-3 ACEO checklist for high-value healthcare Clinicians and health systems are now tasked with concentrating on ways to support the best evidence in the care delivered to patients, while emphasizing patient-centered care and openly seeking patient preferences and input. This will require efforts at all levels from the bedside to the C-suite. Indeed it is the only way to ensure that we deliver on the promise of healthcare value for our patients. It is attainable. There are shining examples lighting up across the country, driven by dedicated people that come to work every day striving to help others feel better. BOX 16-1: Institute of Medicine Recommendations for Continuously Learning Healthcare Systems 333 Foundational Elements Recommendation 1: The digital infrastructure. Improve the capacity to capture clinical, care delivery process, and financial data for better care, system improvement, and the generation of new knowledge. Recommendation 2: The data utility.

Washington, DC.: National Academies Press; 2013. A CALL TO ACTION We can all imagine a better American healthcare system. One that consistently delivers effective, efficient, safe care in humanistic ways and not only harnesses advancements in medicine and technology to heal physical ailments, but also truly supports health and happiness for all of us. A healthcare system that we all can be proud to work in. One that we could confidently send our family members into and trust they will get great care. Perhaps when we do not feel the need as health professionals to serve as personal advocates and watchful eyes for our own family members whenever they access healthcare, then we will know that the system is truly working. 334 Confronting such a large problem will require a concerted effort from individual clinicians along with systemic transformations. Together, we can take charge and help transform healthcare. KEY POINTS: • An “implementation science” field of study aims to help effectively translate evidence into practice. A key component of these efforts is to obtain authentic frontline clinician engagement in the design, implementation, and modification of projects aimed at changing behaviors. • Many healthcare organizations have begun to apply methods and lessons from other industries to cut waste, improve efficiency, and enhance reliability. Lean management principles, chiefly emerging from the Toyota Production System, have proven to be powerful tools for some early adopters, including Virginia Mason Medical Center. • Individual clinicians, equipped with the right tools and resources, can help provoke change within their own groups and institutions. There are a number of resources to obtain the foundational knowledge and supplies for improvement projects, including the free Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School. • The future of healthcare improvement depends on creating continuously learning healthcare systems that can deliver on the promise of constant advancement in the delivery of healthcare that is safer, more efficient, less costly, and increasingly focused on the needs and experience of our patients. • It is up to all of us to help create a healthcare system that we will consistently be proud to work in and that will reliably deliver better outcomes for our patients, families, and selves.

He splits his nights between working as a server at a small restaurant, and his true passion—playing guitar in a local rock band. He is currently uninsured, but has always been healthy. This evening he was waiting tables at the restaurant when he began to have pain in his lower abdomen. He tried to ignore it and keep working but it steadily worsened. By the time he returned home from his shift, he was clenching his belly, uncomfortable and worried. Not knowing what to do or how worried he should be, he typed, “belly pain” into a search engine on the Internet. A list of “searches related to belly pain” returned 1 : • Appendicitis: “A serious medical condition in which the appendix becomes inflamed and painful.” • Gastroenteritis: “Inflammation of the stomach and intestines typically resulting from bacterial toxins or viral infection.” • Stomach flu: “A short-lived stomach disorder of unknown cause, popularly attributed to a virus.” • Irritable bowel syndrome: “A widespread condition involving recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea or constipation, often associated with stress, depression, anxiety, or previous intestinal infection.” James does not know if his abdominal pain could be something urgent like appendicitis or something “short-lived” like the stomach flu. He becomes very anxious about the emergency department (ED) and how much it might cost. This episode of abdominal pain could cost him about $100 for a simple urgent care visit, a couple thousand dollars for imaging, or tens of thousands of dollars for surgical treatment, and he has no way to know which it will be. He decides that he will try to “tough it out” a little longer. He lies down in bed, but by the middle of the night he is vomiting and curled over in pain. He calls a friend and asks him to come urgently to bring him to the hospital. He ultimately is diagnosed with a ruptured appendix from untreated appendicitis. Adding to Mr Green’s initial uncertainty about access to care and how much it may cost is the fact that once a patient like him with severe abdominal pain arrives at the ED, he really has no way of knowing whether the care that his physician is ordering—and he is paying for—is the most appropriate for his condition. “Price shopping is improbable, if","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_0"}}],["1184",{"pageContent":"that once a patient like him with severe abdominal pain arrives at the ED, he really has no way of knowing whether the care that his physician is ordering—and he is paying for—is the most appropriate for his condition. “Price shopping is improbable, if not impossible, because the services are complex, urgently needed, and no definitive diagnosis has yet been made,” notes San Francisco General Hospital emergency medicine physician Dr Renee Hsia and colleagues in an article about variation in ED pricing for appendicitis. 2 “Even if a patient did have the luxury of time and clinical knowledge to ‘shop around,’ we found … hospitals charge patients inconsistently for what should be similar services.” WHY WE NEED HEALTH INSURANCE In the early 20th century, physicians often individually negotiated fees with patients based on their ability to pay. 3 During this time, out-of-pocket cash payment for medical care was the norm, and by far the most common method of reimbursement. 4 In cases where patients had limited ability to pay, physicians would barter or informally subsidize care by charging wealthy patients more and poor patients less. 3 On the surface, this seems to make the most sense since virtually every other service or commodity that we purchase in the 43 United States is paid for “out-of-pocket.” However, since that time, the complexity and cost of healthcare delivery have increased exponentially. This has made critical services too expensive to pay for in cash for most citizens and challenging to anticipate. Compared to other service industries, healthcare is exceptional for a number of reasons. The first is that many people consider basic healthcare a necessity rather than a luxury. If healthcare is indeed a basic need, then a social contract to insure affordable care is appropriate. This is why health insurance differs from other forms of insurance, such as homeowner’s insurance, which is seen as an optional safeguard and therefore an individual responsibility. The challenge has always been in defining how much healthcare is actually “needed.” In addition, as shown in the case of Mr James Green, the need for and cost of healthcare services are challenging to predict, making it difficult (and often impossible) to adequately plan for these expenses. Even under “more predictable” healthcare scenarios, such as a planned pregnancy where it would be conceivable for one to save for the eventual delivery costs, it is still rarely possible to know whether the cost will be a few thousand dollars for a routine delivery, tens of thousands for needed emergent care, such as a surgical ces","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_1"}}],["1185",{"pageContent":"where it would be conceivable for one to save for the eventual delivery costs, it is still rarely possible to know whether the cost will be a few thousand dollars for a routine delivery, tens of thousands for needed emergent care, such as a surgical cesarean delivery (“C-section”), or hundreds of thousands for a prolonged stay for the newborn in a neonatal intensive care unit to treat an unforeseen problem. It is this uncertainty that underlies why we buy health insurance. Health insurance is important “not just because healthcare is expensive (which it is),” stated Harvard health economists Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra. 5 “Lots of other things are expensive, too, including housing and college tuition, but we don’t have insurance to help us purchase them because they are not uncertain in the way that potentially needing very expensive medical care is.” Another barrier to simple out-of-pocket purchasing of healthcare is that patients strongly rely on healthcare professionals to help guide their decisions. Under many circumstances they cannot make the purchasing decisions on their own since they require specialized knowledge. “Mr. Smith, would you like me to treat your pneumonia with azithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone or intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam?” This is not a fair question to ask a patient that does not have adequate knowledge about the potential risks and benefits of each of these medications, or the most likely microorganism causing their pneumonia. In the United States, we have health insurance exactly because of the great uncertainty of who will need expensive and potentially life-saving care and when they will need it. We can confidently predict that some of us will be in an accident and need emergent surgical procedures, some of us will contract deadly infectious diseases requiring treatment, and some of us will develop cancer and will require expensive chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We just can’t predict who will need this and when. At its most basic level, all insurance is designed to mitigate risk of financial catastrophe. Insurance ideally spreads this predictable population-level risk among the entire group so that the unlucky afflicted individuals can afford to have these vital therapies when they need it. The idea is that lifesaving therapy should not necessarily deplete one’s life savings.

HOW DID WE GET HERE: A BRIEF HISTORY OF HEALTH 44 INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES Private insurance During World War II, companies in the United States faced a labor shortage, but due to wage and price controls in place they were unable to compete for workers by promising increased wages. Instead, they began to offer insurance as a benefit to entice employees. 4 Thus the “fringe benefit” of employer-sponsored health insurance was born. Following the war, unions began to negotiate for health benefits, and a series of federal rules were enacted regulating how employer-sponsored insurance would be treated with respect to federal taxes and labor negotiations. This led to a rapid increase in private insurance. 6 The number of persons enrolled in private health plans catapulted between 1940 and 1950 from 20.6 million to 142.3 million. 7 At its peak in the year 2000, employer-sponsored insurance covered 66.8% of all nonelderly Americans. 7 Currently, the majority of Americans under the age of 65 obtain health insurance from more than 1.5 million different employers, who in turn purchase insurance plans from more than 1200 different insurers. 8 This has led private insurance in the United States to be a decentralized and nonstandardized system. As discussed further in Chapter 3, this insurance system is built on separate “negotiated fees” to providers. This means that different health plans will pay different rates for the same care to different providers; and providers will accept different rates for the same care from different plans. The question of “how much does surgery for appendicitis cost,” may not be met with an answer, but rather with the questions, “for whom, when, and where?” These complexities and issues have led prominent Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt to state, “If we had to do it over again, no policy analyst would recommend this model.” 7 Regardless, it is the world that we live in and the model that we now must work with.

Who really pays for employer-based health insurance? Although private insurance companies administer the vast majority of employer-based insurance, this system is actually floating on a substantial government subsidy. While employers pay most of the health insurance premiums for their employees, this expense is tax-deductible, resulting in roughly $260 billion annually in foregone tax income for US state and federal governments (in 2009). 9 This is by far the largest of the tax expenditures by the federal government. 9 In addition, despite the term “employer-sponsored insurance,” employees themselves actually pay for their health insurance in the form of foregone wages and other benefits. For example some employers will offer their employees the choice of either receiving health insurance as a pretax benefit or receiving a higher salary. “In 2005, the average premium for family coverage of healthcare was $10,880, which, for the first time, was the equivalent of the wages paid annually to a minimum-wage worker,” health care policy expert Dr David Blumenthal has pointed out. 7 “Thus, nested within the compensation package of each American worker with family coverage is the equivalent of another worker paid the minimum wage.” Increasing medical costs (premiums plus out-of-pocket expenses plus taxes devoted to healthcare) have led to stagnant real incomes for US families over the past decade. 10 Individual private insurance. An alternative to employment-based health insurance is individual private insurance. Individual insurance is a relatively small but growing market. This is partially driven by the 45 relentless skyrocketing annual premiums that have led employers, particularly small businesses, to no longer offer comprehensive benefits. 11 In 2009, 11 million nonelderly Americans had private individual health insurance at some time during the year. 12 Individual insurance generally costs more than employer-based insurance due to additional administrative and marketing costs and the higher risks that insurers bear with these policies. 11,13 In addition, individuals have less bargaining power in negotiating premium fees compared with larger employers—a fact that motivated the formation of health insurance exchanges under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), detailed below. More than half of adults who tried to purchase individual insurance in 2007 found it very difficult to impossible to find a plan they could afford, and 36% said they were turned down or charged a higher price because of a preexisting condition. 11 As many as three-quarters of those seeking coverage in the individual insurance","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_4"}}],["1188",{"pageContent":"found it very difficult to impossible to find a plan they could afford, and 36% said they were turned down or charged a higher price because of a preexisting condition. 11 As many as three-quarters of those seeking coverage in the individual insurance market between 2004 and 2007 did not end up buying a plan, most often because the premium was too high. 11 Traditionally, these plans also tend to have less generous benefits than employmentrelated insurance, such as higher deductibles and copayments (Table 2-1 for insurance term definitions) and lower likelihood of prescription drug coverage. 12 This ultimately leads to higher out-of-pocket costs for patients. 14 Table 2-1 Common health insurance terms and definitions 46 In summary, due to multiple economic factors, an increasing number of Americans are seeking private individual health insurance, and thus may be at great risk for higher premiums and exposure to out-of-pocket costs. 11,14 Government-financed insurance In a system where the majority of insurance is employment based, naturally as Americans age and retire they would no longer be covered. This leaves those who generally need healthcare the most—the elderly—without any insurance. In fact, in the late 1950s, less than 15% of the elderly had health insurance. 15 In addition, those that are unemployed, and therefore often poor, are also left out of an employment-based market. In response to these significant gaps, President Lyndon B. Johnson enacted tax-financed government health insurance in 1965, aiming to provide affordable care for the elderly (Medicare) and the poor (Medicaid). 16 Although the creation of Medicare and Medicaid occurred in the 1960s, it is important to highlight that discussions of public insurance have dominated congressional debate since at least the 1930s. Shortly following his first election in 1932, President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided not to pursue universal healthcare. 7 Although President Roosevelt had led the expansion of other government programs and had assigned a group to work on proposals to add healthcare reform to the Social Security Act, this met staunch resistance from the medical establishment, including prominently from the American Medical Association (AMA) who denounced “socialist medicine.” 17 Despite the resistance, some see this as the most likely opportunity to have established national universal healthcare in the United States.

It also provides coverage for those under 65 years if they have end-stage renal disease, or are blind. In 2012, Medicare covered approximately 50 million Americans, representing one-sixth of the total population. 18 The Medicare program is structured into four parts (Table 2-2: Medicare Parts A-D). Table 2-2 Medicare parts A-D 48 Medicare plays a fundamental role in providing healthcare coverage for elderly Americans. 19 About 40% of people on Medicare have at least three chronic medical conditions, and almost a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have cognitive impairments. 20 These patients frequently visit physicians, obtain expensive healthcare services, and often require hospitalization. In fact, almost 50% of Medicare beneficiaries are hospitalized at least once over a 4-year period. 21 Despite its noble mission to provide affordable healthcare for the elderly, “Medicare by itself offers only limited protection against economic ruin.” 19 During the last 5 years of life, average out-of-pocket expenditures for patients with Medicare were almost $40,000 for individuals and more than $50,000 for couples in which one spouse dies. 22 This is at least partially due to the fact that the “basic benefit lacks a cap on out-of-pocket spending, so beneficiaries are exposed to the risk of open-ended cost sharing, which can generate substantial financial strain (or deplete assets for surviving spouses).” 19 In fact, the end-of-life expenditures described above exceeded baseline total household assets in a quarter of all patients, and 43% of patients’ spending surpassed their nonhousing assets. 22 On a national level, Medicare spending was estimated in 2012 to account for 21% of total national health spending. 18 Medicare spending per person is rising slower than private insurance, but the elderly population is growing.

Without Medicaid, most of these beneficiaries would be uninsured or lack the coverage for care that they need. 23,25 The federal government requires that a broad set of services be covered under Medicaid, including hospital, physician, laboratory, x-ray, prenatal, preventive, nursing home and home health services. 24 Medicaid improves access to care for a group of patients that generally would otherwise be uninsured. 26 As discussed further below, the ACA is leading to a large Medicaid expansion in most states (Figure 2-1). 50 Figure 2-1.

Managed care and the counterrevolution During the 1990s, managed care promised to control costs without imposing financial risk on patients. Managed care limits patients to visiting only certain doctors and hospitals, whose costs of care and treatment are being monitored aggressively by a managing company. Healthcare maintenance organizations (HMOs) are generally recognized as the first form of managed care. There were some early successes, with the rate of increase in real healthcare costs falling about two percentage points below its historical trend during the 1993-1997 period. 27 This stretch of low cost-growth had not been seen since prior to World War II. 27 However, a strong backlash by both the public and healthcare providers against managed care took hold. This led to a counterrevolution, “in part because providers disliked the increased price competition and because neither providers nor consumers liked the command-and-control utilization review methods.” 27 Perhaps the public perception of the evils of the managed care system at the time was best embodied via Hollywood dramatic hyperbole. The 2002 feature film starring Denzel Washington, titled “John Q,” 28 followed a man whose son was diagnosed with an enlarged heart, but whose HMO insurance refused to cover a necessary heart transplant. John Q then took a full hospital hostage until the hospital would put his son’s name on the heart donor recipient list. The “us versus them” ethos was clearly galvanized. Another example 51 was an iconic commercial sponsored by the Health Insurance Association of America featuring “Harry and Louise,” an average American couple who despaired the government getting involved in healthcare using the message “if they choose, you lose.” 29 The recoil from managed care led to a strong swing of the pendulum and subsequent unrestricted healthcare practices and resultant cost growth for the next decade. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 On March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the comprehensive health reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as “Obamacare” or “ACA”). 30 As Vice President Joe Biden infamously whispered during the ceremony—and was picked up by a nearby microphone —“Mr President,","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_8"}}],["1192",{"pageContent":"legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as “Obamacare” or “ACA”). 30 As Vice President Joe Biden infamously whispered during the ceremony—and was picked up by a nearby microphone —“Mr President, this is a big [expletive] deal.” 30 The ACA is primarily aimed at decreasing the number of uninsured Americans and reducing the overall costs of healthcare. It also contains reforms hoping to improve healthcare outcomes and streamline healthcare delivery. 31 The ACA includes numerous provisions to take effect over several years beginning back in 2010 (see timeline, Figure 2-2). Figure 2-2. The Affordable Care Act—timeline. (Adapted from: Key Features of the Affordable Care Act, By Year | HealthCare.gov. http://www.healthcare.gov/law/timeline/full.html. Accessed August 13, 2013.) The most relevant piece of this legislation for the context of this discussion is the expansion of insurance coverage via two major mechanisms: the expansion of Medicaid coverage and the establishment of state-level 52 health insurance exchanges. The Medicaid coverage expansion was designed to cover all adults whose family income is below 133% of the federal poverty level (approximately $15,000 for a single individual and $30,000 for a family of four) by 2014 32,33 ; however, the Supreme Court ruling in 2012 allows states to choose whether or not to expand their Medicaid programs. 34 The other major attempt under the ACA to increase health insurance access is the implementation of health insurance exchanges, which are meant to provide more organized, transparent, and competitive markets for individuals seeking to buy health insurance. 32 The idea is that these exchanges offer clear information to people to help them pick an insurance plan that best suits their needs. Health plans participating in the exchanges are also required to offer a package of “essential benefits” (such as basic maternity and newborn care). 35 The ACA provides insurance premium subsidies for people living below approximately $88,000 for a family of four (or 400% of the federal poverty limit in 2014). 31,32 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) originally estimated that the legislation would reduce the number of uninsured residents by 30 million, leaving 25 million uninsured residents in 2019 after the bill’s provisions have all taken effect, but in July 2012 the CBO updated the estimate by raising the expected number of uninsured","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_9"}}],["1193",{"pageContent":"reduce the number of uninsured residents by 30 million, leaving 25 million uninsured residents in 2019 after the bill’s provisions have all taken effect, but in July 2012 the CBO updated the estimate by raising the expected number of uninsured by 3 million, due to the successful Supreme Court legal challenge to the ACA’s mandated expansion of Medicaid. 36 Among the remaining uninsured will be 37 • Undocumented immigrants • People who do not sign up for Medicaid (citizens not enrolled in Medicaid despite being eligible) • People who feel that insurance is unaffordable (citizens not otherwise covered and opting to pay the annual penalty instead of purchasing insurance [likely mostly younger and single Americans] and citizens whose insurance coverage would cost more than 8% of household income and are exempt from paying the annual penalty) • People who live in states that opt out of the Medicaid expansion and who qualify for neither existing Medicaid coverage nor subsidized coverage through the states’ new insurance exchanges THE UNDERINSURED A lot of focus has been paid to the striking number of uninsured in the United States, but merely having insurance coverage does not necessarily protect patients medically or financially. There is no universally accepted definition for the term “underinsurance,” but it generally refers to healthcare insurance that requires excessive out-of-pocket expenditures, has significant limits regarding what services are covered, or fails to cover healthcare expenses that are perceived by the insured person to be essential to his or her health. 38 Another way to think about it is that “underinsurance” occurs whenever there are potential barriers to healthcare access due to out-of-pocket costs of care for people who have health insurance. 39 In 2007, there were an estimated 25 million Americans considered to be underinsured. 40 Of note, this does not include the 45 million Americans with no insurance at all at that time. In one study published in 2012, 1 in 6 parents reported that their child was underinsured. 41 With the surge in the number of Americans— particularly young Americans—now being enrolled in high-deductible health plans (see “High-deductible health plans”), the number of underinsured in the United States is at an all-time high. 40,42 A study by the 53 Commonwealth Fund proclaimed that full implementation of the ACA could potentially reduce the number of underinsured adults by 70%, 43 although this remains to be seen.

Underinsurance and increased cost sharing is associated with less access to care, foregone medical treatments, and high financial stress for patients. 40 EVERYBODY PAYS: COST SHARING FOR PATIENTS Different health plans have different degrees of “cost sharing.” These fees paid by individuals for specific medical services come in the form of copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and other “consumer-driven health plan” mechanisms (Table 2-1 contains definitions for common insurance terms), as discussed below. Copays and coinsurance A copayment is the amount paid by the insured person each time a medical service is accessed. This is technically different than coinsurance, which is a percentage payment after the deductible up to a certain limit. Coinsurance payments usually contribute to the policy out-of-pocket maxima, whereas copays generally do not. Insurance companies designed these mechanisms with the idea of discouraging “moral hazards” with regard to unnecessary care. Moral hazards describe the situation in which one has a greater tendency to take risks (or in this case, seek unnecessary care) because they are not exposed to the costs that could incur. It is like playing roulette using someone else’s stack of money—you do not feel the risk. Conversely, designing insurance that requires cost-sharing with patients can discourage necessary care as well. The best evidence for this is described by the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment, which is explored in further detail below. Briefly, the experiment demonstrated that patients with the highest coinsurance rates utilized the least care. However, this cost-sharing resulted in a detrimental effect on a variety of health outcomes ranging from visual acuity to blood pressure control. Recent work suggests even small amounts of cost-sharing may deter patients from important services such as mammograms. 44 Cost sharing strategies are typically used by payers to discourage individuals from choosing more costly services. For instance, some insurance companies set the copay percentage for non-generic drugs much higher than for generic drugs (see Chapter 13). One of the problems is that physicians—sometimes unwittingly— prescribe brand-name drugs causing patients to potentially have higher copays. In one study, 4 of 10 physicians reported that they sometimes or often prescribe a brand-name drug to a patient when a generic is available because the patient wanted it, but","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_11"}}],["1195",{"pageContent":"— prescribe brand-name drugs causing patients to potentially have higher copays. In one study, 4 of 10 physicians reported that they sometimes or often prescribe a brand-name drug to a patient when a generic is available because the patient wanted it, but it was unclear how informed these patients were of the higher costs. 45 As previously discussed, copays and coinsurance can lead to substantial out-of-pocket costs. High-deductible health plans A deductible is a certain amount of money that insurance policy holders must pay before their insurance begins to pay for any services. A deductible may apply to all care in a year, or it might be service-specific (ie, a health plan may have a $500 deductible for each hospitalization). High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) are defined by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as plans that have “(1) a higher annual deductible than typical health plans, and (2) a maximum limit on the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket medical 54 L expenses that you must pay for covered expenses. Out-of-pocket expenses include copayments and other amounts, but do not include premiums.” 46 The federally mandated minimum and maximum annual deductibles for HDHPs in 2012 are shown in Table 2-3. Note that under these plans a family could be liable for up to $12,500 in out-of-pocket medical expenses (in addition to paid premiums) during a single year. 46 Table 2-3 The minimum and maximum annual deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for highdeductible health plans in 2013 More Americans than ever before are currently on HDHPs, leading to increasing numbers of insured, nonelderly adults having difficulty paying their medical bills. 42 Story From the Frontlines—“All This for a Migraine?” ast year, I experienced one of the scariest moments of my life.

After taking a break to watch a Sunday afternoon football game alone in my apartment, I sat down at my desk in an attempt to finish writing a paper.

I spent several anxious hours in the Rhode Island Hospital Emergency Room, eventually being seen by the attending physician, a third-year medical student, and neurologist consultant. They all suspected that I had experienced a “silent” migraine, but the neurologist suggested that I get an MRI to make sure. Since I was dealing with the US health care system, I first had to go to my primary care physician who would then make a referral so that the MRI would be covered by my health insurance. After meeting with my primary care doctor, I received the referral; the next step was to find a testing center that was part of my “preferred provider network.” Luckily, there was an imaging center at my local hospital, which was part of the preferred network. Later, I got the MRI results back from my primary doctor who said that everything looked okay and that it must have been only a migraine. Ironically, that’s 55 when the real headache started. Several months after the migraine incident, I got a bill for close to $2000. The bill was for the MRI that I received at the hospital. I called the hospital to see what was going on and they told me that I needed to call my health insurance company. When I called the claims agency for my insurance, the agent told me that I had been charged for using an out-of-network provider (ie, I owed 70% of the total cost of the procedure). I was advised to call the hospital billing department to ask them to resubmit the claim so that they could check to see if my visit was covered within the provider network. I called the hospital and the agent said that he would pass the information on to the billing department.

I have a better understanding of how confusing and complex the costs reimbursement system in the US can be and I feel a great deal of empathy for anyone who suffers as a consequence of the bewildering morass that exists.

(www.costsofcare.org) Health savings and flexible spending accounts In an attempt to give individuals more control over their healthcare spending and utilization, health savings accounts (HSAs) were created by the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. 47 HSAs involve pairing HDHPs with the establishment of an account that can be funded with pretax dollars and used to pay for eligible healthcare expenditures. Accounts are akin to a bank account and contributions may earn interest. They are owned by the individual, therefore are portable even after workers leave their job. HSAs are similar, but technically not the same, as health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). HRAs involve employers (rather than the employee) making the pretax contributions to the account to be used by the enrollee. 46 The employee does not own the account in this situation, thus HRAs are not portable. A flexible spending arrangement (FSA) may receive contributions from the employee or an employer. 46 Together these 56 plans may be referred to as consumer-driven health plans (","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_14"}}],["1198",{"pageContent":"not own the account in this situation, thus HRAs are not portable. A flexible spending arrangement (FSA) may receive contributions from the employee or an employer. 46 Together these 56 plans may be referred to as consumer-driven health plans (CDHP). “Sort of like anchovies or the New York Yankees, no one is neutral about CDHPs,” radiologist and healthcare administrator Dr Michael Pentecost has stated. 48 “Health policy analysts either love them or hate them.” In general, they are a good deal for the young and healthy (who use less care and are unlikely to spend from their account) and a worse deal for the older and chronically ill (who use more care and are much more likely to spend from their account). The selective enrollment of young healthy patients into these plans could lead to stratification of the insurance risk pools in the market, ultimately leading to higher premiums for those who are sick. HSAs are designed in order for patients to have “skin in the game” when it comes to using medical services. There is some evidence that CDHPs do indeed lead to less health spending, with one study showing that enrollees in HSAs spent roughly 5% to 7% less when compared with traditional health plan enrollees. 47 HOW COST SHARING EFFECTS PATIENT BEHAVIOR The classic RAND health insurance experiment The RAND health insurance experiment (HIE)—a landmark randomized field trial of different insurance plans—began in 1971, led by health economist Joseph Newhouse, PhD. 49 It was a 15-year effort that cost multimillion dollars, in which 5809 patients were randomly assigned to insurance plans with different coinsurance rates, making it the largest health policy study ever. 49 The program randomly assigned people to different kinds of health plans ranging from completely free care (no cost sharing) up to “catastrophic plans” that had 95% coinsurance rates and included a maximal annual payment up to $1000 (in 1970s dollars; would be more than $6000 today). There were also intermediate groups with 25% and 50% coinsurance rates. The group followed participants’ behavior between 1974 and 1982. The study was designed to address two questions: 1. How much more medical care will people use if it is provided free of charge? 2. What are the consequences for their health?

The study was designed to address two questions: 1. How much more medical care will people use if it is provided free of charge? 2. What are the consequences for their health? Results Perhaps not surprisingly, having to pay out-of-pocket for health services led to less utilization. In fact, participants in the 95% coinsurance plan used 25% to 30% fewer services than those in the free-care plan. On average, they had two fewer physician visits per year and were almost a quarter less likely to be hospitalized in a year. Despite this decrease in utilization, there was little to no effect on the health of the majority of patients. With one very important exception: low-income people with poor health ended up disproportionately going without care that they needed. The study concluded that cost sharing reduced inappropriate or unnecessary medical care (overutilization), but also reduced some appropriate or needed medical care. As the study’s primary investigator, Dr Newhouse summarized: “For most people enrolled in the RAND experiment, who were typical of Americans covered by employment-based insurance, the variation in use across the plans appeared to have minimal to no effects on health status. By contrast, for those who were both 57 poor and sick—people who might be found among those covered by Medicaid or lacking insurance—the reduction in use was harmful, on average.” 27 The decrease in the use of medical services by the high-coinsurance group had adverse effects on some conditions such as visual acuity 50 and blood pressure control. 51 Most concerning, the rise in blood pressures is likely to translate to increased mortality in this group. Implications The results of the RAND HIE, which suggested that modest levels of cost-sharing among the nonpoor decreased the use of unnecessary services and did not have substantial health effects, led to the restructuring of private insurance and helped increase the stature of managed care. In many ways, this study opened the doors for increased cost sharing in the 1980s and 1990s. Statewide Medicaid expansions One ongoing study that provides more recent and persisting evidence of the effects of cost sharing has been dubbed “The Oregon Experiment.” 52 In 2008 Oregon enrolled 10,000 uninsured low-income adults into its Medicaid program, from a lottery of almost 90,000 applicants.

This set-up a natural, opportunistic randomized control trial of the effects of Medicaid coverage comparing those that were accepted and those rejected by the lottery. During the first 2 years of this study, Medicaid coverage increased the use of healthcare services, raised rates of diabetes detection and management, lowered rates of depression, and reduced financial strain. 52 But, disappointingly there were no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes during this time. Other studies have looked at statewide Medicaid expansions compared to similar states without expanded coverage and found that these insurance expansions have been “significantly associated with reduced mortality as well as improved coverage, access to care, and self-reported health.” 53 Of note, these Medicaid patients also spent more money on healthcare, contributing to the conclusion by health economists Katherine Baicker (Harvard) and Amy Finkelstein (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) that early results from Medicaid expansions “cast considerable doubt on both the optimistic view that Medicaid can reduce healthcare spending, at least in the short run, and the pessimistic view that Medicaid coverage won’t make a difference to the uninsured.” 54 Prescription drug cost sharing As discussed in more detail in Chapter 13, most insured patients are now covered by incentive-based prescription drug programs in which drugs are assigned to one of several tiers based on their cost to the health plan and other factors. Some plans may require beneficiaries to pay coinsurance (a percent of the total cost of the medication). This strategy is meant to incentivize the use of generic or low-cost brand-name medications. While this may be sound in concept and even prove to be successful in many instances, a number of studies have shown some adverse effects of medication cost sharing, such as lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence among existing users, more frequent discontinuation of therapy, and higher rates of hospitalizations and ED visits in certain populations. 55-57 58 KEY POINTS: • Most consumer goods in the United States are paid for via out-of-pocket payments, but medical care presents many inherent issues—including unpredictability and reliance on specialized knowledge—that make this an inadequate payment method for the majority of patients. • Methods of paying for healthcare in the United States currently include (1) out-of-pocket payments, (2) individual private insurance, (3) employment-based private insurance, and (4) government-financed programs (Medicare and Medicaid). • Due to","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 2 - Paying for Healthcare in the United States_17"}}],["1201",{"pageContent":"of paying for healthcare in the United States currently include (1) out-of-pocket payments, (2) individual private insurance, (3) employment-based private insurance, and (4) government-financed programs (Medicare and Medicaid). • Due to the rising costs of healthcare benefits, insurers have enacted increasing methods for sharing costs with those that receive the benefits.

For the past 2 weeks though he has not been able to shoot hoops due to low back pain. Two Saturdays ago, he cleaned out his garage and was moving around heavy boxes. He awoke the next morning feeling an aching pain in his low back, with an occasional intermittent sharp pain when he moved in certain positions. The discomfort seemed to be worse with bending and standing, and after lying down for long periods. After 2 weeks of using ice and heat packs, and Tylenol, with only temporary improvements, he decided to go see his doctor. His doctor asked him a number of questions about the pain, ensuring that he did not have any bowel or bladder incontinence, fevers, weakness or numbness in his legs, or other concerning neurologic symptoms. He performed a full examination including a neurologic exam, which was completely normal except for some limited back mobility due to discomfort and some tenderness surrounding the lumbar spine region. The physician explained to Mr Anderson that his back pain was almost assuredly “benign” and would get better slowly over about 4 to 6 weeks, but then suggested that he would order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of his back, “just to be sure.” Approximately one-quarter of American adults have had low back pain that lasted at least 1 day in the last 3 months, 1 leading low back pain to be the fifth most common outpatient complaint. 2 In the United States, we spend a lot of money on back pain. The direct expenditures annually are similar to that for diabetes and for cancer. 2,3 And yet for low back pain we are not actually making people much better. Between 1997 and 2005 the United States had rapidly increasing medical expenditures for low back pain, but there were no measurable improvements in outcomes for patients, including self-assessed health status, functional disability, work limitations, or social functioning. 2 Expensive imaging tests are a major contributor to these excessive healthcare costs. 4 The problem is that abnormalities on imaging are as common in individuals with and without back pain.

More than 57% of asymptomatic people over 60 years have abnormalities on lumbar MRIs. 5 Clinical guidelines published by the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend against obtaining imaging in any patient with low back pain without “red flag” symptoms—specific symptoms that are considered concerning for certain possible underlying diseases—within 4 to 6 weeks of onset, since imaging of the lumbar spine before 6 weeks does not improve outcomes but does increase costs. 4,6 The American College of Radiology (ACR) agrees that imaging is frequently overused in the evaluation of low back pain and notes that most patients return to normal activity within one month regardless of imaging. 7 Despite a mountain of evidence and clear guidelines, about 40% of family practice and 13% of internal medicine physicians reported ordering routine diagnostic imaging for acute low back pain. 8 Dr. Shubha Srinivas and colleagues from the University of Connecticut estimate that more than 3.8 million Americans receive routine imaging for low back pain each year (Figure 4-1). 9 This places patients at risk of excessive radiation (in the case of x-rays and computed tomography [CT] scans), costs, and substantial cascading 85 downstream effects. 10 In addition, unnecessary imaging may lead to substantial out-of-pocket costs, particularly for patients like Mr Anderson who have a high-deductible insurance plan (see Chapter 2) and therefore are responsible for up to the first few thousand dollars in costs. The further downstream effects of back imaging include undue worry, perceptions of worsened back pain and/or lessened overall health status, 11 and even unhelpful spine operations. 12,13 Figure 4-1.

WHAT IS “VALUE” The meaning of “value” in healthcare—very roughly defined as the output of healthcare per unit of cost—may differ widely whether considered from the perspective of the patient, provider, or payer. 14 “Value in healthcare depends on who is looking, where they look, and what they expect to see,” Harvard cardiologist and journalist Dr Lisa Rosenbaum has suggested. 14 For clinicians, value may mean decreasing overuse and inefficiency, while improving compliance with evidence-based care. But for patients, creating value may signify enriching the patient experience and concentrating on patient-centered outcomes. 14 86 These differing perspectives have created a gap that must be investigated and bridged. However, at the most basic level there is general agreement that value should include cost, outcomes (or quality of care), and patient experience. And it is clear that currently there is substantial room for improvement in all of these areas (see Chapter 1). Defining value from the perspective of patients and clinicians We believe that clinicians should begin to consider the value of a healthcare intervention similarly to how their patients think about it. Many others have also warned that value in healthcare should consistently be defined by what actually matters to patients. 14-16 This is because when considered from the perspective of the patient, value has the power to unite the interests of all players in the healthcare system. 15 So, how do patients weigh the healthcare “value equation”? In most instances the quality (“the numerator” of the value equation) of the recommended test/procedure/medication may be summarized as simply “what will this do for me?” Notably missing from the brief conversation above with Mr Anderson was any indication of what the potential benefits of undergoing the MRI would be for him. Patients should understand the potential benefit to them personally of recommended tests, procedures, or medications. The growing interest in measuring and addressing clearly defined patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) is discussed in Chapter 12. Whether or not clinicians explicitly address benefits, one must understand that patients will automatically weigh their perceived benefit with their own values, history, and context surrounding medical care. A patient whose father died at the age of 57 from prostate cancer that was metastatic to the spine will likely view back pain very differently from someone like Mr Anderson who has never directly known anybody with cancerous bone lesions causing pain.

Clear communication between medical staff and patients is vitally important, and has been shown to improve appropriate testing by reducing underuse, overuse, and misuse. 17 In a randomized clinical trial, women who were fully counseled about testing options, had undergone exercises to clarify their personal values, and had financial barriers removed were measurably better informed and chose to undergo prenatal genetic testing less frequently than other women. 18 As for costs (“the denominator” of the value equation), this may prove to be even more nuanced for patients and clinicians. Although weighing quality with cost is how almost all other consumer decisions are made, healthcare has traditionally not been determined this way. As we discussed in Chapter 3, this is at least partially because true healthcare costs and quality information have broadly been hidden from patients and physicians, contributing to both groups’ difficulties in making rational decisions about healthcare. Furthermore, most patients are shielded from the full cost of medical purchasing decisions by their health insurance (see Chapters 2 and 3). Some patients may not necessarily be concerned about their healthcare resource consumption. In one study, interviews with privately insured patients revealed that few of them understood terms such as “medical evidence” or “quality guidelines,” and most believed that more care automatically meant higher-quality care. 19 The idea that receiving less care could actually be safer and be of higher-quality seemed counterintuitive. “I don’t see how extra care can be harmful to your health,” one participant said. 19 “Care would only benefit you.” 87 In fact, some patients may explicitly equate more costly care with better care. Despite a vocal contingent of patients who express this view, it is quite obvious that in many instances patients do care a lot about their healthcare costs. Indeed, healthcare costs lead many patients to postpone or skip needed care, 20 and it is increasingly clear that the financial harms alone can be substantial for patients. 21-23 Since value depends on “what matters to patients,” and patients are generally concerned about the monetary costs of medical care, we believe that financial costs should be included in modern clinician risk/benefit calculations. 21 The costs considered in the value equation should not only focus on financial costs but also include other costs potentially incurred by patients, such as possible physical harms, downstream effects, and anxiety.

In the case of routine back imaging, this may include out-of-pocket costs, the logistics of missing a day of work, the story one heard from a friend about the claustrophobia of lying still in the MRI tube, and the anxiety of worrying about being “unwell.” 11 These additional costs to patients may be summed in terms of the overall experience of care. Even an objectively improved outcome may not be worthwhile to a patient if it entails significant physical or psychological suffering. 24 To be clear, this does not mean that patients in the right age and risk group should not undergo testing, such as back imaging, when warranted, but rather that clinicians should understand the personalized value equation that patients may be, perhaps even subconsciously, calculating. When recognized, the healthcare provider can help patients more explicitly navigate this calculus. Actively engaging patients in their healthcare has been shown to be associated with better health outcomes and care experiences, 25 and possibly even lower costs. 26 Most clinicians are currently unaware of the cost of routinely ordered tests, 27 but to explain the potential options and their fiscal implications to patients, health professionals should take responsibility for knowing the financial ramifications of the care they are recommending. 21 This does not always require knowing the exact dollars-and-cents costs, but clinicians can utilize resources so to at least provide estimates within an order of magnitude. For instance, the clinician should be able to, at the very least, point Mr Anderson to a resource to check with his insurance about how much the MRI would cost him out-of-pocket (see Chapter 12 for some examples of emerging tools for cost transparency). There are also multiple emerging tools, which are discussed in Chapter 13, for clinicians to evaluate and possibly decrease out-of-pocket costs of prescription medications for their patients. Of course, one of the best ways to deflate medical bills is to avoid interventions that do not make patients healthier—such as inappropriate back imaging. Avoiding unnecessary medical tests, procedures, and treatments is the easiest way to simultaneously improve quality of care, safety, and patient experience, and decrease costs. 28 The differences between “value” and “cost” Although “value” has emerged as a catchall term to encapsulate the quality, experience","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care_4"}}],["1212",{"pageContent":"the easiest way to simultaneously improve quality of care, safety, and patient experience, and decrease costs. 28 The differences between “value” and “cost” Although “value” has emerged as a catchall term to encapsulate the quality, experience, and costs of care, it often gets conflated into being about costs alone. In the past, value improvement was met with skepticism by both physicians and patients, who feared it was being used simply as a euphemism for blanket cost controls. 29 Even today the terminology is confusing. Some may conjure up images of McDonald’s “value meals” or the local diner’s “blue plate special”—not really an appealing metaphor for a healthcare service. However, to be clear, we do not use value here as a code word for cost reduction. 88 The distinction between cost and value is critical (Table 4-1). Certain high-cost interventions are extremely beneficial in the right setting. An MRI scan provides excellent value for the evaluation of a suspected epidural abscess (a collection of infected pus around the spinal cord), but that same study is considered low-value when used for routine evaluation of common low back pain, since it does not improve outcomes. On the other hand, there are other interventions that are typically low-value, regardless of cost, because they do not improve patient outcomes under almost any circumstances, and even may cause harm. Table 4-1 Cost, benefit, and value of medical interventions Consider the routine, rather than clinically indicated, replacement of peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVs). Most hospitals require that PIVs be replaced in inpatients every 72 to 96 hours. This has been shown to be a wasteful practice with no difference in rates of infection or phlebitis (inflammation of the blood vessel) for patients compared to replacing PIVs only when they have failed or show evidence of emerging infection. 30-32 Even though the individual cost saving from saving plastic PIVs is rather minimal, this practice could likely be completely eliminated without negatively affecting patients.

This means that simply concentrating on return on investment is likely an inadequate way to assess the success of healthcare strategies aimed at improving value for patients. 33 Therefore, although cost is part of the value calculation, it does not solely define it. Simply put, value is increased either by improving the quality of care delivered to patients at similar costs, or by reducing the total costs involved in a patient’s care while maintaining quality. The improvement of healthcare value, when appropriately applied, stands to benefit patients, clinicians, payers, and medical systems. Defining value from the healthcare system perspective 89 In order to assess whether the delivery of a healthcare service is high-value, it is useful to couch value improvement efforts within the shared goals of the health system as a whole. In 2007, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) proposed a framework for optimizing health system performance known as the “triple aim” (Figure 4-2) 28 : Figure 4-2. The IHI triple aim. (The IHI Triple Aim framework was developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge, Massachusetts (www.ihi.org). Reproduced, with permission. Accessed January 30, 2015.) • Improve the experience of care • Improve the health of populations • Reduce per capita costs of healthcare These aims are interdependent and require a balanced approach. 28 If not taken together, some health systems may improve quality while generating exorbitant costs. Alternatively, haphazard application of these aims could lead to decreased costs but at the detriment of the patient experience or quality of care. Therefore, it is vital that these three goals are pursued equally and simultaneously. If a space shuttle with excellent insulation design exploded due to faulty fuel mechanics, nobody at NASA would be celebrating the good insulation; they would be lamenting the overall failure of the mission. The triple aim has been broadly adopted as an aspiration of many health system improvement efforts but it can be challenging to implement. With many moving parts that must be tackled in tandem, it requires the dedication of frontline clinicians as well as health systems leaders. It also requires a way of defining, measuring, and prioritizing the components of the value equation at the healthcare system level.

System-based outcomes The triple aim goals imply a focus on the bottom-line results achieved—not just the volume of services delivered or the number of patients that are cared for. 15 Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter has helped popularize a tiered “Outcomes Measures Hierarchy” with implications for both healthcare quality and patient experience 15 : • Tier 1: Health status achieved (survival; degree of health recovery) • Tier 2: Process of recovery (time to recovery and time to return of normal activities; disutility of care or treatment process) • Tier 3: Sustainability of health (recovery and nature of recurrences; long-term consequences of therapy) This hierarchy suggests a way not only of parsing outcomes that are meaningful, but also for prioritizing 90 them. Ideally care is provided with an efficient and sustainable process (tiers 2 and 3), but improved health status (tier 1) must be demonstrated foremost. The outcomes hierarchy is most easily applied to care where the processes of care are highly standardized. There also must be a clear endpoint where success can be declared. Osteoarthritis of the knee requiring a joint replacement provides a commonly cited example—most patients are treated similarly and in all cases the successful endpoint is a patient who can return to normal physical function without experiencing pain (Figure 4-3). The tier 1 outcome is therefore how many patients achieve this endpoint. The tier 2 outcome may be how long it takes to achieve this endpoint, and the tier 3 outcome may be how long this endpoint lasts before the patient relapses into pain and dysfunction. Figure 4-3.

For these patients, using “time to recovery” as a tier 2 outcome measure may not be valid, particularly when comparing their recovery to patients whose functional status is not limited by other medical conditions. When comparing outcomes at the system level we lose a lot of detail regarding each patient’s prognosis and personal treatment goals. By assuming standardization in care, we 91 sometimes overlook important patient-level differences. Still, we clearly need to start measuring outcomes somewhere, even when the measures are imperfect. Often, we can supplement outcome measures by moving upstream in the care delivery pathway and focusing our attention on the processes of care that we suspect lead to good outcomes. Although we care most about end results, process measures are often more actionable because they inform how care can be delivered differently. Roughly, process measures are “what health professionals do to people,” whereas outcome measures are “what happens to people” (also see Chapter 16). 34 An example of a process measure for a total knee replacement may be whether or not the patient received appropriate preoperative antibiotics. Administering antibiotics before performing this type of surgery is likely to improve outcomes by decreasing infections. Nonetheless a 100% track record of administering antibiotics does not tell you about whether or not the surgery itself was successful. Outcomes depend on many factors aside from health services. Even if a patient presenting to an emergency department (ED) with a heart attack received “atrocious care,” he still may have a good outcome—if one did nothing for this patient other than provide pain relief, he would still have a 60% to 70% chance of surviving and being able to resume his daily activities. 34 The patient’s outcome would be considered great, but their care would have been appalling. In some cases process measures are much more sensitive to differences in quality of care. However, when compared to outcome measures, process measures may ignore many other potentially vital variables and intangibles (such as technical expertise) that could make or break quality. 35 Ultimately, processes and outcomes are part of a continuum that connects the inputs and outputs of healthcare delivery (Figure 4-4). Both types of measures have trade-offs when viewed alone, thus are best used in combination. Figure 4-4. Processes and outcomes.

As it turns out, there is more to it than just adding up the numbers—particularly when trying to connect the dots between where the money is going and the actual care that is taking place. One episode of care can require many different types of resources from personnel to equipment to space and supplies, each with different capabilities and costs. 36 Consider a middle-aged woman who goes to an ED with chest pain. First, she will encounter the intake personnel who collect basic information about who she is. A triage nurse will then take her vital signs and ask basic questions before directing her toward an ED examination room. A nurse draws her blood and delivers the sample to a technician to bring to the lab. The lab personnel process the sample and run tests on expensive lab machines. Another technician stops by the patient room to obtain an electrocardiogram, which is given to the physician for interpretation. A chest x-ray is obtained by a separate radiology technician and reviewed by a radiologist. Up until this point, most of the people and equipment used to care for her needed to be paid for by the health system whether or not she showed up in the ED that day. Then the ED physician gets involved. He spends a variable amount of time examining the patient and 92 reviewing all of the pertinent data. The decision is made to admit her to the hospital, so the ED physician calls a hospital medicine physician to “sign-out” the patient by describing the patient, work-up, and suspected diagnoses. The ED nurse calls the floor nurse and provides her own “hand-off” of the patient. All of this occurred before the patient was even officially admitted to the hospital, which is when things become even more complicated and idiosyncratic. How exactly should this patient’s hospital encounter be properly financially accounted for? Traditionally, we haven’t really tried to do this with great precision. As long as we generally get paid more than we spend, we have been content to instead bundle the money that is being spent into different categories of costs that are not always well connected to individual episodes of care. These costs are often thought of in layers, with “variable” costs on top (most connected to episodes of care), “fixed” costs at the bottom (least connected to episodes of care), and then “mixed","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care_9"}}],["1217",{"pageContent":"connected to individual episodes of care.

A limited understanding of how costs connect to processes of delivering care may be at least partially responsible for why many clinical quality improvement (QI) efforts fail to deliver bottom-line results. 37 Table 4-2 Behavior of various cost layers in the healthcare system Variable costs depend directly on the amount of care that is being delivered. Items that account for variable costs are fully “consumed” if they are used (like the disposable gloves a nurse dons before collecting a patient’s blood sample). The converse is also usually true: if the item is not used, it will be available for later use, providing opportunities for savings. Variable costs include many of the items used to stock a supply closet or 93 pharmacy shelf (catheters, bandages, medicines, etc). Because these items are within the direct control of clinicians, they are often considered ideal targets for reducing waste. Fixed costs must be paid for regardless of the amount of care that is being delivered. Items that fall into this category also do not get fully consumed with each use and are usually considered to be fixed over some relevant range of time or activity. For example, the cost of keeping the lights on in the emergency department is fixed over the course of a shift of work. The costs of major equipment like MRI machines are fixed for a certain volume of patient care. Because fixed costs are independent from the amount of care that is taking place, they are not within the control of clinicians in the short term. Instead, fixed costs are usually addressed over longer operating cycles, well beyond the planning horizon of a single episode of care. It is sometimes challenging to isolate variable costs from the related fixed costs they get bundled with. It has been estimated that hospitals might save at least $650 per blood transfusion avoided. 38 However, transfusing blood entails more than the expense of the blood itself. There is the cost of maintaining the blood bank, the cost of the highly trained personnel that deliver the transfusion, and a host of other costs that are not necessarily within the clinician’s control.

Across many care delivery settings, up to 84% of total expenses may fall into the fixed costs category when the relevant range of consideration is a single episode of care. 39 In between variable costs and fixed costs is a category of “mixed” costs that are sometimes divided into “semivariable” or “semifixed” costs. Like variable costs, resources that generate semivariable costs are available for later use but the ability to repurpose them is limited by time. As a result, these costs can typically only be reduced if there is a sufficient decrease in volume of services. The hourly time of nurses is sometimes accounted for as a semivariable cost. For example, a project to reduce unnecessary PIV replacements may save significant nursing time (on average, nurses spend 10 to 20 minutes total time per IV replacement; in difficult access situations it may take much longer), 40 but it would need to save enough time to warrant one less nurse for a shift to translate into real savings. Semifixed costs may be modified over a relevant range of activity but ultimately must be paid for even if resources are not used during an episode of care. Certain types of replaceable, transferable, or multiuse equipment (like a portable x-ray machine) may fall into this category. Although many so-called “fixed” costs are not easily modifiable at the point of care, some resources are more fixed than others. As a result, the distinctions among the traditional cost layers—particularly for resources that are considered mixed costs—are not always consistent and can depend on institutional accounting preferences. In order to best identify and measure improvement opportunities, some have argued that all costs (even administrative overhead) should be treated as variable and allocated to care delivery activities. 36 The limitation of considering most healthcare costs as fixed is that it focuses cost reduction efforts on a narrow range of variable cost resources while potentially ignoring other high-yield opportunities. 36 Harvard Business School Professor Robert Kaplan has been a particularly vocal advocate of bypassing the traditional cost layers in order to instead account for all costs (variable, mixed, and fixed) as they accrue in real time during the delivery of care.

Using a method called time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) the costs of space, nonconsumable equipment, and administrative overhead are all assigned minute-to-minute cost rates that are relevant to specific processes of care. 36,41 In order to do this, the beginning point and endpoint of an episode of care are first defined. Depending on 94 the goals of the healthcare improvement effort, multiple episodes of care might get bundled into a “care delivery value chain.” For a total knee replacement, this may mean starting with the first preoperative clinical visit and ending with an episode of rehabilitation many weeks after the surgery has taken place. The care that is delivered is then broken down into discrete activities or process steps (eg, check-in, vitals and intake, physician evaluation). For each step, a cost is assigned by keeping track of who is doing which activity, what resources they use, which space they are in, and how long it takes them. Each item (personnel, resources, and space) is assigned a per-minute cost rate by bundling together all costs (fixed and variable) and then dividing by the total amount available for patient care. This method allows you to measure the cost benefits of any process improvement efforts. Using TDABC, you might learn that an orthopedic surgeon costs $5.00 per minute while verifying the patient’s medication history prior to performing the knee replacement operation. You might decide that a medical assistant who costs $2.00 per minute could instead perform this task in order to make the care process more efficient. Kaplan and his Harvard Business School colleague Michael Porter have advocated for a value measurement system that combines the outcome measures hierarchy with TDABC. 15 As health systems work steadily toward achieving the triple aim, these measurements, though imperfect, provide an important means of benchmarking our progress. LINKING VALUE TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY The patient safety and quality improvement (QI) movements of the last dozen or so years were largely galvanized by two landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports, “To Err Is Human” (1999), and “Crossing the Quality Chasm” (2001). 42,43 Following “To Err Is Human,” the media increasingly popularized stories to the public of horrific medical errors such as wrong limb","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care_12"}}],["1220",{"pageContent":"To Err Is Human” (1999), and “Crossing the Quality Chasm” (2001). 42,43 Following “To Err Is Human,” the media increasingly popularized stories to the public of horrific medical errors such as wrong limb surgeries and left behind surgical objects. The proverbial “burning platform” had been set ablaze and momentum was building for improving patient safety and quality of care, even if it was not entirely clear yet how to do so. Early efforts were fraught with missteps. Even seemingly simple interventions such as having surgeons mark the limb to be operated on led to serious unforeseen complications. Without some standardization, some surgeons marked the target limb with an “X,” as in “X marks the spot,” whereas others marked the opposite limb with an “X,” as in “X = do not cut here.” 44 Over the years, more coherent strategies for QI have emerged, but there is still much work to be done to achieve the six aims for healthcare systems set out by the 2001 IOM “Crossing the Quality Chasm” report: patient safety, patient-centeredness, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity. 43 To clinicians, improving the quality of care inherently depends on the effective delivery of evidence-based medicine. The problem is that there is a tremendous amount of drop-off at each stage between the translation of science into appropriate care delivery and patient experience (Figure 4-5). 45 At each step of the way, failures lead to missed opportunities, waste, and harm. Many of the goals of QI are aimed at strengthening these connections. The goal is to more consistently and efficiently deliver advancements in science all the way to the bedside. 95 “C Figure 4-5.

On the flipside, medical errors, adverse events, and preventable complications lead to significant costs in morbidity and monetary measures.

Story From the Frontlines—“Actually, High-Tech Imaging Can Be High-Value Medicine” an you hear it?” she asked with a smile. The thin, pleasant lady seemed as struck by her murmur as I was. She was calm, perhaps amused by the clumsy second-year medical student listening to her heart. “Yes, yes I can,” I replied, barely concealing my excitement. We had just learned about the heart sounds in class. This was my first time hearing anything abnormal on a patient, though it was impossible to miss —her heart was practically shouting at me. Her mitral valve prolapse—a fairly common, benign condition—had progressed into acute mitral regurgitation. She came to the hospital short of breath because her faulty valve was letting blood back up into her lungs. Though it was certainly frightening, surgery to fix the valve could wait a few weeks. But before doing anything, the surgical team wanted a picture of the blood vessels in her heart. If the picture showed a 96 blockage, the surgeons would have to perform two procedures: one to fix the blockage, and another to fix her valve. If her vessels were healthy, though, the surgeons could use a simpler approach focused just on her valve. So she came to the interventional cardiologist who was teaching me for the day. Coronary angiograms are the interventionalists’ bread-and-butter procedure, done routinely to look for blockages and to guide stent placement. They involve snaking a catheter from the groin or arm through major blood vessels and up to the heart.

Under fluoroscopy (like a video X-ray), the cardiologists shoot contrast medium into the arteries, revealing the anatomy in exquisite detail. The images are recorded electronically and accompanied by the cardiologist’s interpretation for anyone else who opens her medical record. Though routine, these catheterizations aren’t trivial. Whenever you enter a blood vessel, you introduce the risk of bleeding and infection. Fluoroscopy is radiation, and contrast medium can damage the kidneys. And let’s not forget cost—reimbursing the interventional cardiologist, a radiology technician, and nursing staff costs Medicare almost $3,000 per case. So I asked the cardiologist if such an invasive approach was really necessary. I knew the rationale—the surgeons needed to know if any of her vessels were blocked, so they could incorporate repairing them into their surgical plan. In a young, otherwise healthy patient, the likelihood of a blockage was low. But in open-heart surgery, “unlikely” isn’t enough. They needed to know her anatomy definitively. I still wondered if there was a less invasive approach to get the same information. I knew I was entering delicate territory, since these catheterizations are how he makes his living. So I was surprised to hear his answer when I asked if CT angiography would’ve done the trick: “Probably, but the surgeons aren’t comfortable with it. They only trust catheterizations.” CT angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive way to get detailed information about the anatomy of the heart. It’s like a regular CT scan, except that pictures are taken after an injection of contrast medium. The total costs to Medicare were about $500 in 2009. A study has shown that in low-risk patients with a positive stress test, starting with CTA (and catheterizing only when CTA is positive) can save an average of $789 per patient, with a small increase in radiation exposure but little change in accuracy. Now, I’m just a medical student. I’m in no position to decide when interventions are necessary or needless. And I certainly won’t tell a cardiothoracic surgeon what information they need to operate.

I have no doubt that this is true much of the time. But reducing the issue down to one axiom is deceptive and simplistic. It’s not enough to ask what the costs, benefits, and harms of an imaging study will be. We also need to understand what we’re comparing it to. A CT or an MRI will always be more expensive than an X-ray, and if we can get the same information from the latter, the more advanced images are indeed wasteful. But compared to catheterization, exploratory surgery—or worse, misdiagnosis—advanced imaging is a steal. It’s cheaper and often less harmful than the more invasive alternatives. The crucial question is who should undergo imaging. If our patient were likely to have a blockage and need catheterization anyway, it wouldn’t make sense to start with CTA. But since her “pre-test probability” of a blockage was low, CTA could’ve averted a catheterization. This also doesn’t mean hospitals should go on imaging technology shopping sprees in order to save our system money. They are huge upfront investments, carrying perverse incentives to churn patients through in order to break even on the initial cost. And we already have far more of these devices than our peers in the developed world. We could probably make do with fewer. Of course, this is probably not why the surgeons didn’t trust CTA. Their job is to operate safely and proficiently, not to police our use of advanced imaging, and they had no financial incentive to request catheterization. My guess is that when the stakes are as high as when opening someone’s chest, they tend to trust what they know for certain to work. But preferences like these change over time. Our patient’s angiography showed beautiful, intact coronary arteries. Her surgeons will probably go with the less invasive surgical approach, because they have no blockages to bypass. This is great news for her and her family. It would be even greater news if our policymakers and pundits took note of her story, and adopted a more nuanced approach to medical imaging. Eventually the surgeons will come around too.","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care_16"}}],["1224",{"pageContent":"blockages to bypass.

High-cost and high-tech, in the right patients, can also be high-value. —Karan Chhabra. “Actually, High-Tech Imaging Can Be High-Value Medicine.” The Health Care Blog (www.thehealthcareblog.com) and Costs of Care, 2014 (www.costsofcare.org) CHALLENGES There are many substantial obstacles to the definition of healthcare value. These challenges are not insurmountable, and we present them here as the beginning of the conversation (see also Chapter 10). Much of our discussion throughout this book will focus on the way forward for clinicians and healthcare systems. Undefined measurements 98 The first step to improving quality is measurement. And yet cost data in healthcare remains frustratingly opaque. 50 American businessman, engineer, and former head of Intel, Andy Grove has likened the current situation in healthcare to the plight of the automobile consumer of the 1950s. 51 “In the early 1950s, it was nearly impossible to know the value of an automobile,” he wrote. 51 “They had prices, yes, but these would differ radically from dealer to dealer, the customer a pawn in the hands of the seller.” Those buying a car had no way to know the true quality of the vehicle, nor how much it is really worth. This all changed in 1958, with a Congressional bill that introduced the “window sticker.” Soon all vehicles sold in the United States included a manufacturer’s suggested retail price along with clear and meaningful quality metrics such as the car’s fuel economy. 51 This revolutionized the process of purchasing a car and “made automobile pricing rational and understandable.” 51 There is still no “window sticker” for healthcare pricing or costs. As many have previously commented, “consumers often know more about the pros, cons, and costs of televisions, cars, and appliances than they do about healthcare interventions.” 52 Cost transparency is a necessary early step toward measuring healthcare value; however, it does not solve the entire problem. Even if we have open access to costs, there will still be","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care_17"}}],["1225",{"pageContent":"visions, cars, and appliances than they do about healthcare interventions.” 52 Cost transparency is a necessary early step toward measuring healthcare value; however, it does not solve the entire problem. Even if we have open access to costs, there will still be plenty of debate about how best to define the “costs” and “outcomes” in the value equation. 53 As discussed in Chapter 3, there are major fundamental differences between healthcare prices, costs, and reimbursements. Furthermore, since for healthcare systems value should include entire populations and episodes of care, there will need to be some consensus on which downstream costs and benefits should be included in value analyses. 53 And how should one deal with opportunity costs? These are among many questions that will need to be adequately answered. Chapters 10, 15, and 16 further explore issues with accurately measuring and defining quality and costs. Insufficient evidence-base The delivery of high-value care depends on the appropriate and efficient execution of evidence-based care. But the problem is that we lack reliable data for the vast majority of real-world clinical decisions. Even when there is adequate guidance from randomized controlled trials, it takes an average of 17 years for this evidence to be incorporated into practice (“the lifetime of a cicada”). 43,54 Not only is slow adoption an issue, the guidelines themselves are based on trials with extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria that may not be generalizable to the heterogeneous population that a clinician actually sees in practice. 55 Despite an astronomically increasing medical knowledgebase, the vast majority of clinical decision-making remains unchartered. The many challenges notwithstanding, the delivery of high-value care—in essence, aiming to make good on the promises of the triple aim—is a noble task that warrants the dedication of clinicians and healthcare systems united in overcoming these obstacles. The goal is deceptively simple: provision of the best quality care for patients delivered efficiently, safely, consistently, and at lower costs for both individuals and our nation. KEY POINTS: • The triple aim includes the interdependent goals of improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita costs of healthcare. 99 • A simple definition of value in healthcare is quality divided by costs, or, more specifically, health outcomes achieved per dollar spent. However, there are currently substantial challenges in appropriately defining and measuring these variables. • True improvements in value are dependent on either measurable improvement in outcomes measures (morbidity, mortality) and","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 4 - Defining Value - Connecting Quality and Safety to Costs of Care_18"}}],["1226",{"pageContent":", or, more specifically, health outcomes achieved per dollar spent.

However, process measures and intermediate outcomes remain important as actionable items, particularly for local efforts. • A more-than-decades-long progression in QI has led to an emphasis on measuring and improving healthcare value.

It wasn’t overly dramatic. It was the response of a man trying to put on a brave face and hide his pain, but—as I gently laid my hands on his belly—failing against his best ef orts. This man had real abdominal pain, the kind that is impossible to not immediately empathize with. I got concerned. “How long has this been going on?” I asked, while my mind began to immediately tick through a dif erential diagnosis. “Well it probably started a year ago, but got really bad about four months ago,” this otherwise healthy-appearing, 30- something-year-old man said. We were in a small curtained-of area in the hectic Emergency Department at San Francisco General Hospital. I was an internal medicine resident in my last year of training. I started to wonder what in the world would possibly cause somebody to wait many months with severe abdominal pain and rectal bleeding before coming to see a doctor. I asked a few more questions, verifying that he was indeed having bright red blood with his bowel movements, had lost at least 10 pounds over the last few months, and has dealt with nausea and debilitating abdominal pain ever since the end of last year. So, I pulled out one of my most tried-and-true questions that I had picked up during residency: “What made you come to the hospital today as opposed to yesterday or last week?” The answer should have surprised me. “Well, I didn’t want to see a doctor because I couldn’t pay for it. I had to wait until my benefits kicked in so that I had insurance.” The Emergency Department had already put him through the CT scanner prior to calling me to admit him to the hospital, to ensure that he “didn’t have something really bad going on,” which I have to admit that if you had put your hands on his abdomen you would probably think was a reasonable (if not very eloquently phrased) concern. The CT scan showed inflammation of his colon in a pattern that the radiologist said was very likely Crohn’s disease.

Then he asked me one of my most feared questions: “But how much will that all cost and will my insurance pay for it?” “I wish that I could answer that for you, but I really don’t know.” 104 Now, the thing is that I had actually spent more than the past year working on cost awareness for residents and looking into issues related to costs of care, and even I couldn’t answer this question in a straightforward and truthful manner. This man needed these things done and costs be damned. Sure, but let’s be honest, his concern is very real. (Christopher Moriates, Costsofcare.org, May, 2012) It has been well established that in general both patients and physicians do not know how much medical interventions cost their patients or the medical system. 1-5 Patients often experience “sticker shock” at the time they obtain a bill weeks after having received some form of healthcare. Comedian Julian McCullough explained this dreadful situation on an episode of National Public Radio’s “This American Life” 6 : “I found out [about the cost of my hospitalization] when I got a bill in the mail for $45,000—in the mail, with the other mail, like it was just more mail. But it was a bill for $45,000—in a white envelope, like all the other envelopes. That should not come in a white envelope—that should come in a black envelope with a skull-and-crossbones on it, and when you open it a picture of your hopes and dreams falls out and burst into flames, because now you owe the hospital $45,000.” This chapter introduces how the landscape of cost consciousness in healthcare is rapidly changing, for both clinicians and the public. Despite the burgeoning attention paid to “out-of-control” healthcare costs recently, this is not a new problem. Unaffordable healthcare—on both national and individual levels—is like a cancer that developed decades ago and without adequate treatment has inexorably festered, grown, and metastasized to affect other economic sectors of our society.

HEALTHCARE COSTS BECOME A NATIONAL CRISIS Some physicians and ethicists may warn that the separation of medical care and costs is an important, necessary aspect of the medical profession, ensuring a firewall between clinicians’ medical decisions and their financial incentives (see Chapter 6). However, this separation is actually relatively new to the profession of medicine. As previously discussed, prior to the rise of medical insurance, basically all medical care was paid for by out-of-pocket cash payments and/or by bartering (see Chapter 2). 7 Therefore physicians and patients were often acutely aware of all the costs associated with their medical care and delivery. Even as late as the 1960s, about 50% of healthcare costs in the United States were paid out-of-pocket. 8 As third-party insurance grew to dominate the market, healthcare costs became less transparent and more difficult for individuals to cover. In 1965, it was recognized that healthcare costs had begun to pose a menacing threat to Americans’ wallets. As he signed Medicare into law, President Lyndon B. Johnson proclaimed: “No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that [older Americans] have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years.” 9 As previously discussed in this book, Medicare has played a critical role in providing healthcare coverage for the elderly, but it has not necessarily fulfilled its promise to avoid damaging personal expenses for patients and their families, particularly during the last few years of life. 9,10 By 1969, President Nixon declared that healthcare costs were a crisis. 11 At this time, healthcare represented an “unsustainable” 7.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Over the past 45 years, the crisis 105 has not been averted; healthcare spending per capita has relentlessly increased each year since. 12 Why has this happened? There are many driving factors that have contributed to this current situation. As discussed in the preceding chapters, inflated and irrational medical pricing, lack of cost transparency, clinical inefficiencies, and inappropriate overuse have all played important roles. “The tragedy of the commons” There is also a broader behavioral science perspective that may best illustrate our situation.

In a 1968 article in “Science,” biology Professor Garrett Hardin described what he referred to as “the tragedy of the commons.” 13 He noted that much like adults playing a game of “Tic-Tac-Toe,” this dilemma did not have a “technical solution.” He portrayed an open pasture shared by a group of cattle herdsmen. In this scenario, naturally each herdsman will want to keep as many cattle as possible. This will likely work out fine for centuries since conditions such as wars and disease keep the numbers of both men and cattle well below the carrying capacity of the land. However, social stability is reached one day and “the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy.” The reason is that each herdsman rationally seeks to maximize his own gain. They sense that adding a few more cattle to their herd will directly benefit themselves. On the other hand, a few more cattle will have only a minimal effect on the overall general welfare of the group. In other words, all will share the incremental cost on the land of adding another animal. Of course, as each herdsman behaves rationally in this way, eventually the meadow will become overgrazed resulting in catastrophe that will affect all. Hardin concludes: “Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited.” 13 “Ruin,” warns Hardin, “is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.” 13 Much like Hardin’s grazing area, medical resources are also finite. And many patients and clinicians have doubtlessly thought, “Well, what’s one more MRI, even if it might not be necessary?” Over decades, this behavior has eaten away at medical resources, and now the toll is being paid across various sectors of society. In 1975, Dr Howard Hiatt (then Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health) famously repurposed the “tragedy of the commons” for healthcare, calling on physicians to collaborate with other experts and the public in order to protect the “medical commons.” 14 However, “not only have we failed to rise","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery_3"}}],["1236",{"pageContent":"Health) famously repurposed the “tragedy of the commons” for healthcare, calling on physicians to collaborate with other experts and the public in order to protect the “medical commons.” 14 However, “not only have we failed to rise to his challenge,” University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Professor Dr. Molly Cooke noted in 2010, 15 “but our overconsumption and waste are now compromising our ability to address other pressing social needs and national priorities.” Story From the Frontlines—“How Much Will My MRI Cost?” pproximately one year ago, I developed a phantom pain in my left eye that no doctor—whether primary care physician, neuro-opthalmalogist, or even neurologist—seemed to be able to diagnose. It was difficult 106 A enough to describe the pain, let alone repeatedly be told there was nothing visible creating it; the root cause did not seem to exist anywhere tangible that could lead to a potential diagnosis. I was eventually given a referral by a neurologist to get an MRI, both of the orbital areas of the cranium and of the brain. As a graduate student on a student health insurance policy, I double-checked my insurance coverage to make sure that I would have enough money for this procedure. MRIs are notoriously not inexpensive. The result was that for every referred procedure there would be a maximum of $2,000 covered, leaving me to pay for the rest. I initially looked online to find some sort of general idea for the pricing of MRIs. The hospital where I was to have the procedure did not list pricing online. I had to look elsewhere, and eventually located a website that provided an average cost for MRIs of various kinds based on a handful of hospital submission from the Boston area, my hospital not included. The website reported costs of approximately $1,000 to $2,500 per MRI of the brain and orbits. With this in mind, I called my hospital’s main helpline and inquired and inquired about where I could find the price per MRI for this particular hospital. I was told they did not give out such information, but was referred to the radiology department, who told me that they were unaware of the pricing of procedures.

When I returned for spring semester approximately one month later, I received a bill in the mail for more than $6,000. The total for the two MRIs exceeded $10,000. Luckily, the insurance covered each MRI as separate referrals and paid $4,000, instead of $2,000. But I was left then to deal with the remains of this $10,000+ procedure.

(www.costsofcare.org) PROGRESS IN “FITS AND STARTS” Despite election cycles in the early 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s that included public mandates to make healthcare more affordable, progress has occurred in fits and starts. As Drs Andrew Auerbach and Robert M. Wachter from UCSF have put it: “Over the last 30 years, rounds of therapeutic treatments with cost consciousness and cost containment have been administered to the healthcare industry, with generally disappointing clinical 107 response.” 16 Starting back with the Great Depression, more and more people could not afford medical services. This reality led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to propose publicly funded healthcare programs. However, he was met with severe opposition from the medical profession, ultimately forcing him to remove these provisions from the Social Security Act of 1935. 17 Many subsequent policy efforts to reform healthcare have also met staunch opposition by the medical profession.

By contrast, President Obama’s Affordable Care Act was bolstered by the physician-led Doctors for America, and ultimately was endorsed by the American Medical Association. 18,19 For the first time in US history, most major physician organizations were vocally and formally supportive of policy changes to provide more access to affordable healthcare. THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF COST CONSCIOUSNESS AND VALUE Clinician-led efforts to address healthcare costs Over the years, individual clinicians have attempted many times in a myriad of ways to implement their own efforts to address healthcare costs. One often-tried method has been clinician-led educational programs. The first published effort to educate medical trainees about the costs of care was undertaken in 1975, 20 with subsequent efforts transiently appearing during the managed care debate of the early 1990s and other eras of attempted healthcare reform. 21,22 To date, the results of even the most creative efforts have been mixed and conspicuously local. In 1984, Dr Steven Schroeder and colleagues at UCSF accurately predicted the failure of physician education as a stand-alone cost containment strategy. 23 In the 1970s and 1980s, Dr Jerry Avorn at Harvard and others attempted having trained individuals, often clinical pharmacists, provide physicians with information about appropriate prescribing and diagnostic testing. 24,25 This resulted in very modest improvements in prescribing patterns. 25 Chapter 11 includes a full discussion of healthcare value education, including emerging tools and strategies. Other clinician efforts have focused specifically on lab testing. In the 1970s, some administrators tried to bluntly ration lab tests by assigning resident physicians a finite number of “coupons” that could be redeemed for individual lab tests. The problems with this strategy are obvious. And residents predictably displayed their uncanny ability to work around any system that impedes them getting their work done or taking care of their patients: Counterfeit coupons “mysteriously” appeared on the wards and the program was quickly undercut. Some tried educational-driven efforts directed at lab utilization, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, but effects quickly dissipated once the education was stopped. 26,27","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery_6"}}],["1239",{"pageContent":"” appeared on the wards and the program was quickly undercut. Some tried educational-driven efforts directed at lab utilization, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, but effects quickly dissipated once the education was stopped. 26,27 More recently there seems to be a resurgence in these types of efforts. Some education programs coupled with targeted feedback have shown promising results in successfully decreasing lab utilization among residents. 26,28,29 One memorably titled paper by a surgical resident referred to the daily lab practices of “surgical vampires,” and demonstrated impressive results with a simple educational and feedback program. 28 In addition, systems efforts to use technology for providing costs, giving trainee-specific feedback on utilization, or embedding value-based decision-support have recently 108 emerged. 30-32 Of course, only time will tell whether any of these renewed efforts will have any staying power, or if they too will become yet another footnote in the long history of attempts. Key influencers in the clinical professions arena Although many of the recent educational efforts are similar to those tried in the past, it is possible that the overall environment that they are being introduced in has changed. A notable recent development is the number of influential professional organizations that have put forth substantial efforts to address stewardship, overutilization, and healthcare costs. These efforts are remarkable because they have been generated by the healthcare professional organizations themselves, rather than prompted directly by governmental or regulatory mechanisms. It is very possible that with these different inputs, clinicians have now become more primed to care about healthcare costs and resources. A watershed moment for this movement was the widely endorsed 2002 release of the “Physician Charter on Medical Professionalism in the New Millennium,” by the ABIM Foundation which called for minimizing “overuse of healthcare resources.” 33 The American College of Physicians (ACP) subsequently added “parsimonious care” as an ethical responsibility to their sixth edition of the ACP Ethics Manual. 34 The ACP’s “positions on efficiency, parsimony, and cost-effectiveness constitute an important shift, if not in ethics then in emphasis,” stated Dr Ezekiel Emanuel. 35 This shifting ethical landscape will be studied in much more detail in Chapter 6.

As of 2013, they had more than 50 organizations release at least one “top five” list for the campaign (available at www.choosingwisely.org). The concept of these “top five” lists was originally conceived by the National Physicians Alliance, and simultaneously by a 2010 editorial written by University of Texas physician-ethicist Dr Howard Brody in the New England Journal of Medicine. 37,38 The “top five” strategy was then piloted with the creation of three lists for internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics (Table 5-1). 37 Although the focus of these lists is on unnecessary use, there are, of course, inherent cost implications. The potential savings from enacting just these first three primary care “top five” lists could top $5 billion, although notably the lion share of these savings would be from prescribing generic instead of brand name statins. 39 Table 5-1 Top five lists in primary care 109 Choosing Wisely is a campaign aimed at both healthcare professionals and patients. In order to translate some of these recommendations directly to patients, the ABIM Foundation has teamed up with Consumer Reports to provide and disseminate patient-friendly materials about appropriate care recommendations. 40 In fact, one day on my doorstep landed a flyer from Consumer Reports sent to patients with the headline “Imaging tests for lower-back pain: You probably do not need an x-ray, CT scan, or MRI.” The pamphlet proceeded to explain in clear language that these imaging tests “do not help you feel better faster,” “have risks,” and “are expensive.” It provided guidance on when imaging tests “are a good idea” and gave advice on how to treat common low back pain.

While it is easy to identify radiological tests as part of the problem, it is important to note that many radiologists are committed to improved stewardship of resources. For example, prior to the launch of Choosing Wisely, the American College of Radiology (ACR) had released “appropriateness criteria” for imaging in many different situations, including low back pain, to help guide clinicians to avoid ordering unnecessary and wasteful radiological imaging. 41 The Choosing Wisely campaign has gained considerable traction and is even now considered “an understood shorthand” among medical professionals. 42 Part of the initial successes of Choosing Wisely are due to the fact that the framing of the initiative was carefully calculated, and thus “successfully avoided the caricatures of ‘rationing’ or ‘death panels,’ reactions that doomed prior efforts to engage all stakeholders in a reasoned national dialogue about costs and value.” 16 Another reason for the success is the use of trusted medical specialty societies who directly interface with their constituent physician members. As executive vice president and chief operating officer of the ABIM Foundation Daniel Wolfson stated, “There’s incredible leadership being shown by the specialty societies in addressing appropriate care and waste, and a willingness to 110 partner with consumers and patients to talk about these issues.” 43 The ACP has also contributed remarkable leadership in the domain of high-value care. They have led a broad program that aims to help “physicians to provide the best possible care to their patients, (while) simultaneously reducing unnecessary costs to the healthcare system.” 44 The ACP has developed clinical recommendations, physician resources, curricula and public policy recommendations, as well as patient resources to help them understand the benefits, harms, and costs of tests and treatments of common clinical issues. The ACP guidelines and clinical recommendations have created an important evidence-based backbone for many other initiatives and targets, such as efforts to decrease imaging in low back pain, inappropriate prostate cancer screening, and upper endoscopy in gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The IOM also released an influential report in 2012 entitled “Best Care at Lower Cost.” 48 This report provided a compelling argument for the need to radically transform healthcare to provide “continuously learning” systems, and outlined a number of emerging tools and strategies to accomplish this goal. 48 Costs of Care, Inc. is a nonprofit directed by the three authors of this book with a mission to “empower patients and their caregivers to deflate medical bills.” 49 Founded in 2009 by Dr Neel Shah, Costs of Care has held an annual essay contest each year since that time, crowdsourcing hundreds of anecdotes from all over the country that illustrate opportunities to improve the value of care. These stories have provided important insights and have shone a light on many defects currently in the system.

With such a long history of failed attempts at cost containment and improving healthcare value, why would this time be any different? Well, for starters it seems that unlike in the past, this time all of the stakeholders—not just the payers or employers—are aligned in addressing healthcare costs. The need to decrease healthcare costs and pay clinicians for value rather than volume has become one of the very few platforms that both political parties in the United States have agreed on in 2013.

In addition, clinicians increasingly see controlling costs as part of their jobs. 54,55 Some, including the authors of this book, have argued that the damages done to patients by healthcare costs are substantial, and thus clinicians now have a responsibility to consider “out-of-pocket costs as side-effects” or the “financial toxicity” of their interventions. 56-58 In 2013, we called for the well-established mantra of “first, do no harm” to be reconceptualized for this era of unsustainable healthcare spending as “first, do (financial) harm.” 57 Despite these advancements, many physicians are still quick to point the “major responsibility” for healthcare costs at other stakeholders including the insurance industry and malpractice lawyers. 54 In response, some have taken the profession to task for lacking the “all-hands-on-deck” mentality required by the current situation, 59 but the fact is that 93% of physicians recognize that they have at least “some responsibility” in controlling health costs, even if they may be unsure how best to do that (Figure 5-1). 54 Figure 5-1.

Lastly, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) reinforces many efforts aimed at moving toward providing “value” and will give some of the measures administrative “teeth.” On a high level, the ACA creates new structures to facilitate and promote cost reductions and puts in place incentives for both healthcare systems and individual clinicians to improve the value of care that they provide (see Chapter 15). 112 THE WAY FORWARD Part III of this book will largely focus on “solutions,” particularly concentrated on distinct strategies for clinicians on the frontlines, but","metadata":{"namespace":"d026","filename":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery.txt","link":"https://C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery","id":"C:\\Users\\School\\Documents\\GitHub\\LocalAI1\\Search-across-knowledge-bases-with-Langchain-and-OpenAI\\backend\\data\\text-files\\d026\\Understanding Value-Based Healthcare - Chapter 5 - A Changing Landscape - Cost Consciousness and Value in Healthcare Delivery_11"}}],["1244",{"pageContent":"systems and individual clinicians to improve the value of care that they provide (see Chapter 15). 112 THE WAY FORWARD Part III of this book will largely focus on “solutions,” particularly concentrated on distinct strategies for clinicians on the frontlines, but we can introduce some of the overarching concepts here. The “tragedy of the commons” is not unique to healthcare. Much like the growing momentum of the largely youth-driven—but structurally and governmentally supported—environmentalism movement, addressing healthcare costs will take countless marginally incremental efforts from all involved. Sure, turning off your water while you brush your teeth is an infinitesimally small drop in the bucket to preserving overall water resources, but turning off the tap can save up to 20 to 30 gallons of water per person per week. Multiply that by entire communities and you start making a real difference. Just like the “Green” movement, the need to address healthcare resources has become an imperative of our time. It is particularly inspiring that the environmental movement of the late 1960s was led by college students. We have observed that the new value movement in healthcare is largely driven by the enthusiasm of trainees. There are many foundational steps including education, price transparency, and systems changes that need to firmly be in place, and there is clearly no magic bullet here. It will take the sustained efforts of clinicians, patients, healthcare systems, and the government to really affect change. However, also like environmentalism, incredible gains can be made in shifting culture, changing social norms, and pitching-in with an “all-hands-on-deck” mentality. Further drawing from the environmental movement, Drs Donald Berwick and Andrew Hackbarth have adopted a “wedges” model—originally created as a strategy to keep atmospheric carbon dioxide within a sustainable range 60—for reducing spending in US healthcare (Figure 5-2). 61 The solid black line represents a “business as usual” projection for healthcare spending, showing the familiar astronomical growth exceeding increases in GDP, and plotting the road to ruin. But they also present six “wedges,” each representing an area of waste that could potentially be eliminated over time. Together these different strategies each contribute to closing the gap. 113 Figure 5-2. Wedges model for US healthcare, with theoretical spending reduction targets for six categories of waste.

So, in summary, why are we so optimistic that this time the drive toward healthcare value and costconsciousness will stick? For the first time in our history, it seems like the wills of the medical, policy, and public spheres have aligned in the same broad direction. There are still many disagreements regarding the details, the mechanisms, and strategies to achieve these goals. Some of these are based on deeply held philosophical or ideological constructs. While not everyone may agree on the exact best way to get to the moon, at least now it seems everyone has looked up to the sky and settled on where the target lies. KEY POINTS: • Rising healthcare costs have been identified as a problem on both a national and an individual level for many decades; however, costs have continued to rise unabated. • The lack of medical professional engagement helped doom numerous prior health reform efforts, but major physician organizations officially endorsed the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which helped lead to its passage. • Numerous medical professional societies have recently put forth substantial independent efforts to curb healthcare costs and provide high-value care. The ABIM Foundation’s “Choosing Wisely” campaign, 114 the ACP “High-Value Care” initiatives, and the ABIM Foundation-Costs of Care “Teaching Value Project” have created momentum in this era of renewed enthusiasm for improved healthcare value.

Welton What’s a Nurse’s Value? Making Cents of Care I magine if, at the end of a shift, every nurse wrote out a bill for the care he or she just delivered. What would be on the bill and how much would each nurse charge? It is a provocative question and gets to the heart of how to measure the added value nurses bring to the health care system. I have asked that question many times over the years. One place I recall was a hospital cardiac care unit where I was touring the unit with the nurse manager. I asked the billing question to a preceptor orienting a young nurse. She went through her own patients, one patient with routine congestive heart failure and another with complex dysrhythmia, and described the various things that would be included on her patient bills. She looked at the new nurse, smiled, and said she would charge more than her. It was a sobering reminder of the different types of experiences and expertise nurses bring to the bedside and the challenge to measure the value of each nurse. The Value of Each Nurse We struggle with the question: what is good nursing care? Common answers include reduction or elimination of nurse-sensitive quality measures such as injuries, infections, and pressure ulcers. Indeed, Florence Nightingale extolled over 150 years ago: “If a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if a patient is faint, if he is sick after taking food, if he has a bedsore, it is generally the fault not of the disease, but of the nursing” (Nightingale, 1860). The actions of nurses as well as many others caring for the sick and injured have a direct effect on the outcomes of care. However, there is a more personal question: who is a “good” nurse and what are his or her characteristics and virtues? If nursing is measured as the collective efforts of all nurses caring for all patients within a particular setting, how can we distinguish the individual contribution of each nurse? How would we measure perJOHN M.

The question is both timely and relevant as we move toward wider implementation of value-based care. Measuring Nursing Value In a recent article in Nursing Economic$, a group of nurses and others engaged in a national expert panel proposed a method to measure nursing care value (Welton & Harper, 2016). The model identifies key data elements in the electronic health care record to link a nurse and patient as well as identify characteristics of that encounter. For example, a shift assignment in an acute care setting links each nurse and patient. From these data one could measure the workload based on patient acuity or the effects of the experience or academic preparation of each nurse in relationship to the outcomes of care for each patient. By linking nurses to patients in many different settings, we can also determine the actual hours of care delivered and, if a wage is available, calculate the actual or “true” direct nursing cost of patient care. This is relevant as we move toward bundled payment models. Future nursing care delivery models will require more accurate cost metrics to better understand the added value of nurses. Recommendations Where do nurses fit in the overall value equation? As we move forward with health care reform, that answer lies not in measuring nursing care as a composite whole, but as the aggregate of the contribution of each individual nurse. That will require changes in how we measure care toward the performance, costs, and quality of the care provided by each nurse. That raises difficult questions about how to compare or benchmark the care of nurses across different patients and different settings. What if a nurse is not doing well in managing a patient’s pain or giving medication on time? What if the most costly nurses are caring for the least complex or acute patients?

If we do not get the public to engage in the process, if we do not get the politicians to understand the importance, and if we do not have the profession behind us, then research funding will go to other priorities with louder voices. Making research results accessible, understood, and supported by a wide range of stakeholders is a critical step in retaining and increasing research investment. A New Era of Regulation DN: What keeps you up at night? DB: As regulators, we are running to catch up. Change within service delivery is rapid. The regulatory framework we are currently using was designed for an era that is rapidly disappearing. We’re seeing more technology and, therefore, we need to think about how we protect the public in what is a very dynamic and fast-changing environment. The demographics of both health workers and nurses are changing. How do we regulate in such a climate? We are entering a new era of regulation and we need to consider how we will protect citizens in a way that fits 21st century practice. We also need to be mindful a generation of children will have a shorter life expectancy than their parents due to the rapid increase of noncommunicable diseases and obesity-related issues. We need to think about preventative strategies rather than treatment strategies. What does that mean for the educational curriculum and how we supervise practice? We also need to make sure nurses themselves are healthy. Another pressing issue is the ability to rapidly respond and deploy nurses in natural disasters. Failure to provide solutions means public safety is at risk. As regulators, addressing public safety is our prime purpose. DN: Where do you want to make your greatest impact and what would you like to be known for at NCSBN? DB: A former chief executive of Ikea said one of the things that had made his company a success was the ability to steal good ideas with pride rather than waste time reinventing the wheel. When they see good ideas they consider them carefully and figure out how to utilized them. There are a lot really good practices in the 50 states. We should take those examples of best practice and align them to our particular context.

If we can learn from each other and implement those ideas proven successful elsewhere rather than reinventing the wheel, I will be happy. We need to be architects of our future and shift the curve. It’s not about looking for the one or two failures and dealing with them, it’s about seeing how we shift the whole curve so we all succeed and make excellence of practice a reality for all. It is possible if we all pull together. $ REFERENCE Conover, C., & Richards, R. (2015). Economic benefits of less restrictive regulation of advanced practice nurses in North Carolina.

Produce new methods to extract common data from the electronic health record at the individual encounter between a nurse and patient to provide key information about cost, quality, performance, payment, and clinical care. 2. Reconfigure internal costing and billing systems to separate nursing care and charge for nursing care directly to each patient rather than standardize room and board or other average methods. 3. Recommend each nurse apply for National Provider Identifier (NPI) code. Use NPI in all interactions of nurses and patients. If these recommendations are implemented, we will have the ability to identify the added value each nurse brings to patient care. This represents a fundamental shift in how nursing care is viewed. Individual accountability, assessment of performance at the individual nurse level, and allocation of direct care time and costs of each nurse to each patient will provide the links to quality and outcomes of care. We have the ability to implement these recommendations in the next few years. Is there political will and consensus within the nursing community to move forward with these recommendations? Failure to take ownership of the data and metrics to link nurses to value-based care will likely lead to imposition of nursing value metrics from outside the profession. We are at a crossroad and it is time to challenge traditional views of nursing care value.$ REFERENCES Nightingale, F. (1860). Notes on nursing: What it is, and what it is not. New York, NY: D.
