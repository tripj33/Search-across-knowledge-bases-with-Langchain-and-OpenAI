Great, so I'm here with Dr. Tejal Gandhi.
We just finished a great WIHI, The Digital Transformation: How Technology is Helping
and Hurting Healthcare with you and both Bob Wachter as our experts.
So thank you for taking the time.
One question that we didn't get to, we touched on the theme a little bit.
Technology, we're not there yet in healthcare, there's struggles, there's frustration.
People are not happy with technology in healthcare yet.
But you and Bob both had sort of a message of hope.
So let's go there, why should people be hopeful about technology in healthcare?
Well, I think we should be hopeful about technology for a couple of reasons.
One, I think we have good evidence to say these technologies can improve the quality
and safety of the care we deliver.
So no one's saying we should go back to paper.
We know that there's going to be this value that these technologies will bring.
Second, I think there's a lot of innovation that's happening now.
Innovation within vendors, but really in the whole technology community to improve the
tools that we have.
Third, if you look at other industries, and Bob really highlighted this well during the
WIHI, it takes time to optimize these kinds of technologies.
He read a very powerful quote about personal computers and how unusable they were back
in 1991, and yet look how they are today.
So it's unfortunate because it means yes, we might be more in 1991 than today, electronic
health records.
But it also means that there is that future state that we can aspire to and that it will
happen with the innovation and other things that are actively going on right now.
Great, we look forward to getting there.
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
