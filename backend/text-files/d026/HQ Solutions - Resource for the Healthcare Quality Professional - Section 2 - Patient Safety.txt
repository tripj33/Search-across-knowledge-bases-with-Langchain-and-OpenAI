Abstract
Ensuring patient safety is imperative for the healthcare quality professional. The duty of any healthcare professional is to work with others to provide safe care, treatment, and services using current evidence-based principles, practices, and tools. This section offers a comprehensive overview of safety principles and practices relevant to healthcare delivery across the continuum of care. The safety imperative is discussed and various patient safety programs are described. Patient safety culture approaches and systems thinking principles are examined. Practical tools for assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation that healthcare quality professionals can use in daily practice are reviewed. The successful integration of safety concepts and practices results from leadership commitment and the healthcare workforce understanding about what works (and what does not) in healthcare structure and processes. A culture of safety thrives in a learning organization with effective leadership, an engaged and intentional healthcare workforce, and activated patients.
Learning Objectives
1.Provide leadership in the creation and maintenance of a safety culture throughout the organization by assessing needs, developing and deploying the organizational safety plan, and spreading safety concepts using principles such as human factors engineering, high reliability, just culture and systems thinking.
2.Understand how systems of safety, safety culture, reliability, and continuous learning put the patient at the center of safe healthcare delivery.
3.Promote effective risk management strategies through use of safety practices, tools and technology such as incident reporting, sentinel/adverse event review, root cause analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, and checklists.
4.Facilitate the ongoing evaluation and improvement of patient safety using tools and health information technology for identifying risks and harm reduction.
The Patient Safety Imperative
Eliminating errors and reducing harm are imperative to deliver on the promise of the delivery of care, treatment, and services in a safe environment free of errors and harm. The provision of care, treatment, or services across the continuum is composed of various elements including assessing, planning, providing, and coordinating care to address patient needs. This section synthesizes current knowledge related to patient safety, preventing errors, and reducing harm across the continuum of care. Strategic and operational components of developing a patient safety program are presented.
To build an organization’s safety culture means tackling the most important patient safety issues facing healthcare organizations today, which include the following:
•Adopting and sustaining a culture of safety
•Identifying organizational champions
•Deploying and sustaining patient safety strategies
•Determining key drivers for patient safety programs
•Sustaining the gains of implementing safety innovations
•Ensuring the adoption of current and evolving safety-related technologies.
There are many aspects of patient safety that are important such as leadership and the mindful integration of safety concepts into an organization’s vision, mission, strategic plan, goals, and objectives. These aspects are discussed in this section. Patient safety practices and approaches to reduce harm and preventable errors are presented. Guidance is offered for using tools and integrating safety into the healthcare organization’s operations and processes. Comprehensive references, resources, and suggested readings are also provided. Note that the term “patient safety” is used throughout but “patient” represents any label for the user of healthcare services across the continuum such as patient, client, resident, consumer, customer, stakeholder, recipient, or partner.
Transforming Patient Safety in the 21st Century
Medical errors have economic and emotional consequences that are recognized by regulatory requirements for patient safety and error reduction identified in federal, state, and local mandates, standards for practice in accreditation standards (e.g., The Joint Commission [TJC], National Committee for Quality Assurance, and CARF International), and guidance for safe practices using evidence-based guidelines (e.g., the
p. 72
p. 73
National Quality Forum [NQF] and AHRQ Patient Safety Network).
The national imperative and patient safety call for action emerged in the first decade of the 21st century. In 1999, the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 was enacted and the call to action released in the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System. In 2000, there was the first National Summit on Medical Errors. Federal actions to reduce medical errors began to appear (e.g., patient safety grants and a national agenda). In 2001, evidence was published about what providers could do to make healthcare safer. By 2007, Patient Safety Indicators were developed, the National Resource Center formed, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Network launched.1
In 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a proposed rule to update payment policies and rates for hospitals under the inpatient prospective payment system (PPS). The rule included new additions of hospital-acquired infections for fiscal year 2009, including several conditions identified by the NQF as “serious reportable adverse events” (also called “never events”). The complete list of 29 serious reportable events was updated in 2011 is shown in TABLE 2-1.2(pp iii–iv) CMS

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation directed the U.S. Department of Health & Human ­Services (HHS) National Quality Strategy (NQS) “to better meet the promise of providing all Americans with access to healthcare that is safe, effective, and affordable.”3(p2) The development of the NQS would occur with input from various stakeholders to influence a realistic, achievable strategy. Thus, the NQF convened the multi-stakeholder National Priorities Partnership comprising 48 public and private sector partners to provide input as HHS developed the NQF goals, measures, and strategic opportunities.3(p2)
In 2016, the CMS Quality Strategy pursued the NQS aims (Six Aims and The Triple Aim). The HHS NQS’s aims and priorities outlined in the strategy are displayed as FIGURE 2-1.3(p11) The CMS Quality Strategy Goal 1 is to “make care safer by reducing harm caused in the delivery of care.”4(p5) For this goal, different foundational principles are used to support change and improvement including eliminating disparities, strengthening data structures and systems, enabling local innovations, and fostering learning organizations.4(pp10–11) Alternative payment structures in 2016 to 2018 promote quality goal attainment as Medicare will increasingly be making payments to providers that are tied to quality or value.
Figure 2-1 National quality strategy aims and priority areas. (Reprinted from National Priorities Partnership. Input to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on priorities for the National Quality Strategy. Washington, DC: National Quality Forum; Copyright 2011, with permission.)
In September 2016, CMS furthered its commitment to patient safety when it awarded $347 million to continue progress toward a safer healthcare system. Awards were made to 16 national, regional, or state hospital associations, quality improvement organizations (QIOs), and health system organizations for efforts in reducing hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) and readmissions in the Medicare program. This is only part of broader efforts to transform the healthcare system into one that works better for the American people by delivering better care, spending smartly, and focusing on improved health status.
National Strategy for Quality Improvement
The National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care5 describes three broad aims of an NQF: better care, healthier people/healthy communities, and affordable care (i.e., The Triple Aim). The NQF also considers six priority areas for an NQF, one of which is to make care safer. The goals include the following:
•Improve patient, family, and caregiver experience of care related to quality, safety, and access across settings.
p. 74
p. 75
•In partnership with patients, families, and caregivers—­using a shared decision-making process—develop culturally sensitive and understandable care plans.
•Enable patients and their families and caregivers to navigate, coordinate, and manage their care appropriately and effectively.3
The NPP envisions “healthcare that honors each individual patient and family, offering voice, control, choice, skills in self-care, and total transparency, and that can and does adapt to individual and family circumstances, and to differing cultures, languages, and social backgrounds.”6(p17) The NPP partners vowed to ensure all patients
•provide feedback on the experience of care that healthcare organizations will use to improve care;
•access tools and support systems to the effective navigation and management of care; and
•access information and assistance that enables informed decisions about treatment options.6(p8)
Addressing the need to improve the safe delivery of healthcare, Congress passed public and private sector efforts and generated landmark regulations and reports such as the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005, in response to the IOM’s groundbreaking report, To Err Is Human. The IOM was renamed in 2016. It is now the Health and Medicine Division, which is a division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (The National Academies).
Patient Safety Organizations
At the turn of the century, the IOM sparked national attention to avoidable medical errors. Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) evolved from public and private sector concerns. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 20057 conferred privilege and confidentiality protections for providers who choose to work with PSOs. This promotes shared learning from medical errors and improves patient safety across the nation.
To implement the Patient Safety Act, HHS issued the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement final rule.8 The Patient Safety Act and the Patient Safety Rule authorized the creation of PSOs to improve quality and safety through the collection and analysis of data on patient events.9 Now many organizations such as the NQF, AHRQ, and CMS are working together to ensure the success of the work accomplished by PSOs. As of December 2016, there are 86 active PSOs in 29 states and the District of Columbia currently listed by AHRQ.10
PSOs are organizations with the shared goal of improving the quality and safety of healthcare delivery. Eight patient safety activities are carried out by, or on behalf of PSOs or healthcare providers, namely,
1.efforts to improve patient safety and the quality of healthcare delivery;
2.collection and analysis of patient safety work product (PSWP);
3.development and dissemination of information regarding patient safety, such as recommendations, protocols, or information regarding best practices;
4.use of PSWP to encourage a culture of safety and provide feedback and assistance to effectively minimize patient risk;
5.maintenance of procedures to preserve confidentiality with respect to PSWP;
6.provision of appropriate security measures with respect to PSWP;
7.use of qualified staff; and
8.activities related to the operation of a patient safety evaluation system and the provision of feedback to participants in a patient safety evaluation system.10
Organizations eligible to become PSOs include public or private entities, profit or not-for-profit entities, provider entities such as hospital chains, and other entities that establish special components to serve as PSOs. By providing privilege and confidentiality, PSOs create a secure environment in which clinicians and healthcare organizations can collect, aggregate, and analyze data. Privileged information is not subject to disclosure or discovery and cannot be asked about in testimony thereby permitting more candid discussions about quality of care that may reduce the risks and hazards associated with patient care.
Public Reporting
Public reporting in healthcare moved from its starting point with voluntary and/or regulatory agency-driven reporting to mandatory and improvement-focused. Beginning with the reporting of mortality rates by CMS in the 1980s, over the decades more public and private sector reporting development has occurred producing comparable data and science-based methodology. These developments were also framed by stakeholder expectations for accountability, transparency, and improvement. Stakeholders include a host of healthcare providers and payers—government at all levels, health plans, hospitals, ambulatory care, long-term care, physicians and group practices to name a few. Accreditation agencies and private interest groups are stakeholders. And most important, the public and consumer interests and involvement has grown.
As the stakeholder base for public reporting expands and diversifies, Halpern et al. suggest that “public reporting should
p. 75
p. 76
be used to hold systems accountable to their own goals.”11(p32) In linking quality and patient safety efforts, information should be published on what was learned, recommendations and changes made, and the responsiveness of the institution to patient safety issues. There is no doubt that public reporting offers value related to the allocation of the healthcare dollars but work is still needed to better understand what value is brought to the consumer in choosing a healthcare provider or health plan.12
Twenty-seven states plus the District of Columbia had passed legislation or regulation supporting adverse event reporting to a state agency. The laws and regulations were intended to raise accountability in healthcare organizations. Public reporting has the potential to improve patient safety through event analysis and by disseminating lessons learned.13 Eight states use the NQF reportable adverse incident list in their reporting systems; seven states use a modified or partial NQF list, and twelve states use their own non-NQF list.13(p8) The effectiveness of reporting systems is not yet fully understood. However, many reporting system administrators experienced an “impact on communication among facilities, provider education, internal agency tracking or trending, and/or implementation of facility processes to address quality of care. Nine states report increased levels of provider and facility transparency and awareness of patient safety because of their reporting systems.”13(p3)
Examples of current public and private sector reporting efforts are described below.
Reporting and Tracking. An array of reporting and tracking programs related to patient safety have been deployed by the federal government. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System is a database that contains information on adverse event and product complaint reports. These are submitted to the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. It is designed to support the safety surveillance program. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA. VAERS collects information about adverse events that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed for use in the United States.
The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) is far reaching in its tracking and reporting for patient safety. Attention to infection prevention and control began to grow as part of the national effort to achieve “zero” in HAIs. Public reporting of infection rates became the “new clinical mandate.”14(p3) The NHSN also plays a leadership role in promoting patient safety by providing a secure, Internet-based safety surveillance system. Through its efforts, it applies quality and safety improvement methods by
•collecting and reporting on national and state-specific standardized infection ratios;
•providing facilities, states, regions, and the nation with data needed to identify problem areas, measure progress of prevention efforts, and ultimately eliminate healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); and
•allowing healthcare facilities to track blood safety errors and important healthcare process measures (e.g., healthcare personnel influenza vaccine status and infection-control adherence rates).15
In October 2014, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for certain hospitals that ranked in the worst performing quartile with respect to HACs. The measures reflect a composite of NHSN data and AHRQ Patient Safety Indicators.
Expectations about voluntary and mandatory incident reporting systems (IRS) at organizational and system levels are still evolving. In 1999, the IOM advocated the use of IRS. The IOM recommended that “a nationwide mandatory reporting system should be established that provides for the collection of standardized information by governments about adverse events that result in death or serious harm. Reporting should initially be required of hospitals and eventually be required of other institutional and ambulatory care delivery settings.”16 According to a 2014 study by the ­National Academy for State Health Policy, state-level event reporting systems were launched but have not changed since 2007. As of January 2015, there were 28 states with mandates (see TABLE 2-2). Accreditation organizations, like TJC, have voluntary and mandatory event reporting.

Hospital and Outpatient Ratings. CMS began its hospital and outpatient rating and reporting systems with Hospital Compare in 2002. This was a joint effort between Medicare and the Hospital Quality Alliance (HQA). Over 10 years, CMS and the Alliance worked together to grow public reporting efforts in a meaningful way and beyond structural measures of quality including the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS). The HQA ceased in 2012 after accomplishing its goals.
With Hospital Compare and HCAHPS serving as both foundation and experience, CMS continued its development efforts launching other “Compare” programs for healthcare providers across the continuum of care—Physician Compare, Nursing Home Compare, Home Health Compare, Dialysis Facility Compare, and Long-Term Care Hospital Compare. In addition, there are Quality Reporting Systems and Programs for End-Stage Renal Disease,
p. 76
p. 77
ambulatory surgical centers, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, inpatient hospitals, inpatient psychiatric facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, outpatient hospitals, physicians, and QIOs. These programs offer payers and consumers valuable tools for value-based purchasing and selecting providers for personal healthcare services and treatment. Performance on safety measures such as readmissions and HAIs are available.
Heath Plan Performance. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) develops standards and measures that hold health plans accountable for the care provided to their constituents. Their performance measurement system, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ­(HEDIS), is one of the most widely used performance measure data sets that is targeted toward health plans, wellness and health promotion, and disease management programs. This tool is
p. 77
p. 78
used by more than 90% of America’s health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. Because so many plans collect HEDIS data, there is comparability and acceptability by third-party payers. Some patient safety areas addressed by HEDIS include the following:
•Safe and judicious antipsychotic use in children and adolescents
•HAIs
•Follow up after an emergency visit for mental illness, alcohol, and other drug dependence
•Falls risk management (RM).
HEDIS data are publicly reporting with available benchmarks. The results are used by consumers to select the best health plan for their needs by looking at the plan performance and comparing plan performance with other plans.17 HEDIS reporting is third-party payer requirement for health plans.
Safety Grades. The Leapfrog Group is a voluntary initiative that serves to mobilize employer purchasing power to guide America’s health industry in adopting “giant leaps” in patient safety. The group’s mission is “to trigger giant leaps forward in the safety, quality and affordability of U.S. healthcare by using transparency to support informed healthcare decisions and promote high-value care.”18(¶6) In 2001, Leapfrog launched a hospital survey to collect data on three “leaps” (computerized physician order entry, Intensive Care Units [ICUs] appropriately staffed with intensivists, and ensuring enough surgical volume to safely perform certain high-risk procedures). Initially participating hospitals were ranked, but in 2012 Leapfrog began assigning A, B, C, D, and F letter grades. By 2016, the Leapfrog Hospital Survey represented 1,859 hospitals in the United States (60% of hospital beds). Employers and other purchasers as well as health plans and community leaders are using Leapfrog Hospital Survey results and Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades for payment reform and public reporting.
Partnership for Patients
Partnership for Patients: Better Care, Lower Costs is a public–private partnership to help improve the quality, safety, and affordability of healthcare for all Americans. Using as much as $1 billion in new funding provided by the ACA and leveraging several ongoing programs, the DHHS works with a wide variety of public and private partners to achieve the two core goals of this partnership: keep patients from getting injured or sicker in the healthcare system, and help patients heal without complication by improving transitions from acute-care hospitals to other care settings, such as home or a skilled nursing facility. Its mission is to help patients take care into their own hands. The partnership uses Hospital Improvement Innovation Networks that work at the regional, State, national, or hospital system level to sustain and accelerate national progress and momentum toward continued harm reduction in the Medicare program.
Beyond reducing harm caused in hospitals, the Partnership for Patients is an important test of what can occur when the nation acts as one to address a major national health problem. The CMS Innovation Center dedicated more than $500 million to test models of safer care delivery and promote implementation of best practices in patient safety. The Innovation Center “allows the Medicare and Medicaid programs to test models that improve care, lower costs, and better align payment systems to support patient-centered practice.”19(¶1) In addition, CMS provided $500 million for a community-based care transition program created by the ACA to support hospitals and community-based organizations in helping Medicare beneficiaries at high risk for readmission to the hospital safely transition from the hospital to other care settings. More than 7,300 partners, including more than 3,200 hospitals, physicians, nursing groups, consumer groups, and employers have pledged their commitment to the Partnership for Patients.5,20
The Six Aims
The IOM highlighted problems in healthcare delivery. In the seminal IOM report, the Committee on Quality of Health Care in America stated healthcare frequently harms and routinely fails to deliver its potential benefits. It was noted that the American healthcare delivery system needed fundamental change.21(p1) In addition, it concluded healthcare was not being provided with the best scientific knowledge. The IOM report suggested an agenda for “crossing the chasm” by changing the healthcare delivery system. Its agenda includes the following components:
•All healthcare constituencies (e.g., purchasers, healthcare professionals, regulators, consumers) can commit to a national statement of purpose for the healthcare system, setting six aims for improvement to raise the quality of care to unprecedented levels.
•Clinicians, patients, and healthcare organizations need to adopt a new set of principles to guide the redesign of care processes.
•Through the DHHS, a set of priorities must be identified to focus initial efforts, provide resources to stimulate innovation, and initiate the change process.
•Healthcare organizations need to design and implement more effective support processes to make change in the delivery of care possible.
An environment needs to be created to foster and reward improvement in the context of ever-expanding knowledge and rapid change. This is accomplished by creating an infrastructure
p. 78
p. 79
that supports evidence-based practice, uses information technology (IT), aligns incentives with outcomes, and prepares the workforce to better provide care, treatment, and services.
As part of the agenda for change, the IOM outlined six improvement aims to address key dimensions of healthcare quality. At a minimum, healthcare should remain as follows:
1.Safe: Avoid injuries to patients from care that is intended to help them.
2.Effective: Provide care based on scientific knowledge regarding who will likely benefit, and restrain from providing care when it is not likely to benefit a patient.
3.Patient-Centered: Care is respectful and responsive to patient preferences, needs, and values. Furthermore, patient values and preferences guide clinical decisions.
4.Timely: Wait times and harmful delays for those who receive and provide care are eliminated.
5.Efficient: Care is provided in ways that avoid waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy.
6.Equitable: Care does not vary in quality because of the patient’s personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.21
Since the IOM started delivering reports on patient safety in 2000, various national organizations, state and federal agencies, accreditation organizations, and professional associations have focused on the identification of safe practices and strategies for organizational or system-wide implementation. In addition, many states have established coalitions to promote patient safety. For example, the Connecticut Center for Patient Safety promotes “high quality, safe healthcare and the rights of patients by promoting person-centered care, best practices and transparency in healthcare.”22(¶2) Originally organized by residents who had been harmed by the healthcare system, it provides useful tools and resources for consumers. The Oregon Patient Safety Commission (OPSC) was one of the first legislatively mandated organizations to reduce the risk of serious adverse events occurring in Oregon’s healthcare system and encourages a culture of patient safety through patient safety reporting, early discussion and resolution, and quality improvement initiatives.23
The Triple Aim
The Triple Aim was introduced by Berwick et al.24—improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of healthcare. Since it was introduced, thinking about the Triple Aim continues to evolve. A fourth aim or quadruple aim was proposed by Sikka et al.25 who suggest adding improving the experience of providing care, including workforce engagement and workforce safety. Bodenheimer and Sinsky26 suggest that the goal be added of improving the worklife of healthcare providers, including clinicians and staff.
Organizations such as the American Hospital Association (AHA) continue advancing work in patient safety using the Triple Aim to frame principles for practice. In 2016, the AHA reaffirmed its commitment to creating safe and highly reliable healthcare organizations through a culture of high reliability whereby hospitals improve quality and patient safety.27 CMS reframed the aims simply as Better Care, Smarter Spending, Healthier People as the federal government extends financial support for innovation and efforts continue to improve the healthcare delivery system in the United States. In fact, health outcomes are improving and adverse events are decreasing as patient safety improved dramatically, thanks in part to the Partnership for Patients. Patient harm fell by 17%, saving 50,000 lives and billions of dollars.28
Patient-Centered Outcomes
Established in 2012, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has “a sizeable and growing portfolio of projects designed to improve patient care and outcomes through patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER). The research fund is guided by the PCORI five National Priorities for Research and Research Agenda. The work under these priorities is managed by our scientific programs, which track it and evaluate its effectiveness.”29,30(¶1) PCORI established national priorities for patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness that include the following:
•Assessment of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options: Comparing the effectiveness and safety of alternative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options to see which one works best for different people with a health problem.
•Improving Healthcare Systems: Comparing health ­system–level approaches to improving access, supporting patient self-care, innovative use of health IT, coordinating care for complex conditions, and deploying workforce effectively.
•Communication and Dissemination Research: Comparing approaches to providing comparative effectiveness research information, empowering people to ask for and use the information, and supporting shared decision-making between patients and their providers.
•Addressing Disparities: Identifying potential differences in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment effectiveness, or preferred clinical outcomes across patient populations and the healthcare required to achieve best outcomes in each population.
•Accelerating Patient-Centered Outcomes Research and Methodological Research: Improving the nation’s capacity to conduct patient-centered outcomes research, by building data infrastructure, improving analytic methods, and training researchers, patients, and other stakeholders to participate in this research.30(¶2)

Contextualizing Patient Safety
Patient safety reflects science, encompasses practices and interventions, and aims to reduce the occurrence of preventable events. It requires intention, vigilance, and trust to build a culture of safety. These are important as one considers the person and the healthcare delivery system. Patient safety and quality improvement are intertwined. Different techniques can be used to assess performance with the findings used to inform change. “It is important to adopt various process-improvement techniques to identify inefficiencies, ineffective care, and preventable errors, and influence changes associated with systems.”31(p3-1) Through the work of various government, quasi-government, and voluntary groups, different definitions emerged that address the prevention of errors and the reduction of harm, such as the following:
•Patient safety is the “freedom from accidental injury due to medical care or medical errors.”16(p4)
•Patient safety is “indistinguishable from the delivery of quality health care,”32(p5) in a culture of safety where “. . . caregivers are encouraged to report medical errors, ‘near misses,’ or adverse events, where they can be discussed in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect without fear of blame or retribution.”33(p195)
•Patient safety refers to the “freedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care. Thus, practices or interventions that improve patient safety are those that reduce the occurrence of preventable adverse events.”34(¶1)
•Patient safety is “a discipline in the health care sector that applies safety science methods toward the goal of achieving a trustworthy system of health care delivery. Patient safety is also an attribute of health care systems; it minimizes the incidence and impact of, and maximizes recovery from, adverse events.”35(p6)
•Patient safety is “the prevention and mitigation of harm caused by errors of omission or commission that are associated with healthcare, and involving the establishment of operational systems and processes that minimize the likelihood of errors and maximize the likelihood of intercepting them when they occur.”36
•Patient safety is a public health issue. It is “the absence of preventable harm to a patient during the process of health care. The discipline of patient safety is the coordinated efforts to prevent harm, caused by the process of health care itself, from occurring to patients.”37(¶3)
Considering any one of these definitions, one can quickly recognize that there are myriad of patient safety issues across the continuum of care that demand consideration (e.g., hazards and patient complexities in behavioral health environments or the outpatient settings). Some issues may be less obvious but just as serious. Some issues are experienced by most types of healthcare organizations. However, there are issues unique to the setting where care, treatment, and services are provided. The healthcare quality professional will want to be familiar with these to direct patient safety activities in their setting and help define what patient safety means in the organization. TABLE 2-3 offers examples of the kinds of safety concerns that the healthcare quality professional might encounter in different healthcare settings.

Systems Thinking and Patient Safety
Whereas “do no harm” was previously an individual responsibility, a paradigm shift makes “safety a system priority.”21(p67) When patient harm occurs, the cause is frequently traced to flaws in the system of care. Adopting “systems” thinking requires a healthcare organization to think beyond the person and beyond blame. Whereas individual behavior can result in an error, looking at health delivery from a systems perspective enables the organization to identify and manage errors differently. Using a systems approach, the conditions under which an individual works and the complexity of the process are the foci. By recognizing human and process variability in a systemic way, leadership and healthcare personnel can work together to avert errors or mitigate their effects. This is foundational to high-reliability organizations (HROs), which will be discussed later in this section.
Patient Safety Culture
The current era of patient safety ushered in thinking such as achieving zero defects, pursuing perfection, and transforming healthcare.38–40 This thinking influences how organizations create the strategy for culture of safety goals and objectives. Although everyone in the healthcare enterprise is responsible for quality and safety, an organization’s leadership must emphasize safety as a core component of culture, ongoing strategy planning, and of their quality and performance improvement program. Designing an organizational structure for patient safety is like designing a house:
Like the physical structure of a house, organizational structure identifies and distinguishes the individual parts of an organization and ties these pieces together to define an integrated whole. Organizational structure differs from the physical structure of a house, however, in that it encompasses more than inanimate characteristics of walls, doors, and windows. Organizational structure includes the interaction patterns that link people to people and people to work, and unlike a house, structural dimensions of organizations frequently change and evolve.41(p399)
In creating the organizational structure, leadership should not be preoccupied with failure but recognize that their “leadership is the critical element in a successful patient safety program and is non-delegable.”42(p1) Leadership works to ensure that patient safety is supported by a strong but flexible foundation with straight walls, working doors, and opaque windows. In 2017, TJC explained that the role of leadership is essential in developing the safety culture and described 11 tenets that help an organization achieve and sustain a safety culture.43 See FIGURE 2-2 for a description of these tenets.
Figure 2-2 11 tenets of a safety culture. (Reprinted from The Joint Commission. Addition resources. Sentinel Event Alert 57: the essential role of leadership in developing a safety culture; 2017. https://www.jointcommission.org/sea_issue_57/.

The readiness of an organization needs to be assessed for the implementation of patient safety practices. This may typically start at the strategic planning stage with the mission and vision statements, core values, and strategic goals. Reason44,45 suggested that different safety culture elements can be considered:
•Informed culture: Culture in which everyone is clear about acceptable and unacceptable actions. Being informed is supported by the availability of safety data that is actively disseminated.
•Reporting culture: Errant behaviors can be reported without fear of punishment or blame.
•Learning culture: An organization can learn from its mistakes and make changes.
•Flexible culture: The organization and the people in it can adapt effectively to changing demands.
•Just culture: Errors and unsafe acts are not punished if the error was unintentional. Those who act recklessly or take deliberate and unjustifiable risks are still be subject to disciplinary action.
Healthcare organizations committed to a just culture identify and correct the systems or processes of care contributing to the medical error, adverse events, near miss, or close call—they do not assign blame. It is important that the organization is clear about terms used for identifying, investigating, reporting, and disclosure of safety events. Errors, adverse events, preventable adverse events, and sentinel events are described as follows:
•Medical error: An error is defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim. Errors can include problems in practice, products, procedures, and systems.46
•Adverse event: An injury caused by something that happened in the delivery of medical care rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the patient. How adverse events might be categorized could be determined by setting (e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility). Adverse events are sometimes further categorized as follows:
⚬Preventable adverse events: Those that occurred due to error or failure to error or system design flaw.
⚬Ameliorable adverse events: Events that, while not preventable, could have been less harmful if care had been different.
⚬Adverse events due to negligence: Those that occurred due to care that falls below the standards expected of clinicians in the community.47
•Sentinel event: A sentinel event is a patient safety event that reaches a patient and results in death, permanent harm, severe temporary harm, and/or intervention required to sustain life. An event can also be considered sentinel if the event signaled the need for immediate investigation and response.48
p. 82
p. 83
Close calls and near misses are those that never reached a patient, may have reached a patient or reached a patient with no serious harm. Near misses and close calls may be recognized and defined as follows:
•An event, situation, or error that took place but was captured before reaching the patient.49
•An act of commission or omission that had the potential to harm a patient but did not occur due to a planned/unplanned recovery or corrective action and timely intervention.50,51
p. 83
p. 84
•An event or situation that did not produce patient harm due to either chance or capture before reaching the patient or if it did reach the patient, a timely and robust intervention occurred with no subsequent patient harm.52
•An error of commission or omission that could have harmed the patient but serious harm did not occur due to chance, prevention, or mitigation.53
Understanding errors and feeling protected by a nonpunitive culture, more healthcare professionals will report errors, near-misses, and close calls. This in turn will improve patient safety through opportunities for improvement identified and lessons learned.54,55 In a just culture, there is awareness throughout the organization that medical errors are inevitable—humans make errors, systems can be flawed. Just Culture can make the system safer by recognizing competent professionals make mistakes. It also acknowledges that even competent professionals develop unhealthy norms (shortcuts or routine rule violations); nevertheless, this culture has zero tolerance for reckless behavior. Three principles of a just culture are described here:
1.Just culture is not an effort to reduce personal accountability and discipline. It is a way to emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes, near misses, and close calls to reduce future preventable errors.
2.An individual is accountable to the system and the greatest error is to not report a mistake. Doing so prevents the system and others from learning.
3.Policies discouraging any healthcare provider from self-reporting errors are at odds with the goals of a fair and just culture. Even those errors that do not result in harm or injury are reported and serve as learning opportunities.
Success occurs when everyone in a healthcare organization serves as a safety advocate regardless of their position or role. Providers and consumers will feel safe and supported when they report medical errors or near misses and voice concerns about patient safety. How are the human/emotional aspects associated with patient safety balanced with how the system reflects and responds to those human emotions? In building a safety culture, Botwinick and colleagues42 noted when leaders begin asking what happened instead of who made the error, the culture within their healthcare institutions begin to change.
Patient-Centered Care
Consumers are becoming more engaged in healthcare decision-making and more willing to tell their stories to the public when things do not go right. One of the most poignant was the Josie King incident. In 2001, King was 18 months old when she died in a hospital as the result of a cascade of errors including hydration and receiving enough fluids, use of narcotics, and listening to the family when additional assistance was requested for concern about Josie’s condition. Josie’s mother, Sorrel King, later went public with the findings about the breakdowns leading to her daughter’s death at a premier medical system in Baltimore, MD. The Josie King Foundation was established with the mission to “encourage a culture of safety by providing tools that allow health care organizations the ability to communicate, collaborate, improve and share.”56(¶3) Together with the hospital and provider groups, King also founded the Patient Safety Group in 2004, which upholds the mission to “encourage a culture of safety by providing tools that allow healthcare organizations the ability to communicate, collaborate, improve, and share.”57(¶1)
Healthcare professionals respect and include patients and families in decision-making. They keep the patient and the family at the center of all that they do. Research suggests that clinicians working with patients and their families can contribute to a better understanding of their role and ­responsibilities related to safety. A Cochrane ­systematic ­review including 115 controlled studies ­representing 34,444 ­research participants reported that providing patients with decision aids
•improves knowledge regarding their options,
•reduces the decisional conflict,
•increases active role in decision-making,
•improves accurate risk perceptions of possible benefits and harms among patients,
•increases the likelihood that choices are more consistent with their informed values, and
•enhances communication between the patient and the clinicians.58(¶15)
Activated patients—those who manage their own care by having the knowledge, skills, and confidence—are shown to achieve better clinical outcomes.59 The healthcare quality professional’s role includes support of a person-centered approach in developing safety programs and fostering patient and staff engagement. Safety can be advanced through the consideration of different aspects of clinical excellence such as psychological safety (creating an environment where people are comfortable and have opportunities to raise concerns and questions), leadership (facilitating and monitoring teamwork, improvement, respect, and psychological safety), and transparency (openly sharing data and other information concerning safe, respectful, and reliable care with staff, partners, and families). These and other aspects are shown in the Framework for Clinical Excellence (FIG. 2-3).

As consumers become more empowered through consumer-directed healthcare, they will demand more from healthcare organizations. Examples of initiatives to consider in program development for consumer-directed healthcare include the following:
•SPEAK UP Program. TJC empowers consumers by providing educational materials and tools as navigational aids for complex healthcare systems. In 2002, in response
p. 84
p. 85
to a public outcry regarding unsafe practices, TJC, in collaboration with CMS, launched a national campaign to urge consumers to take an active role in identifying and preventing healthcare errors. The goal of the initiative was to empower consumers to become active, involved, and informed participants on the healthcare team.60
•OpenNotes. Since 2010, this national initiative funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, gives patients access to the visit notes written by their doctors, nurses, or other clinicians. Potential positive effects of using an open medical record include catching errors in the notes, preventing diagnostic delay, taking medications as prescribed, encouraging patients to speak up, engaging informal caregivers, and enhancing trust.61,62 OpenNotes has been adopted by facilities and systems of care such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Geisinger Health Systems.
What is known is that engagement results in patient safety outcomes.63 The healthcare quality professional can work with others in the organization to determine how elements of engagement can be incorporated into strategic intent, the safety plan, and other related activities (e.g., structure to support engagement, needed skills, awareness building, and practices).
Health Equity
One of the six aims of a quality healthcare system is equity. In a perfect world, equitable care does not vary based on a patient’s individual characteristics such as sex, gender identity, ethnicity, geographic location, or socioeconomic status. However, disparities exist and include (1) the way healthcare systems are organized and operate; (2) patient attitudes and behaviors; and (3) healthcare provider biases, prejudices, and uncertainty when treating minorities.64(pp2–3) Medical errors can result from ineffective patient-provider communication and the inability of the treating providers to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers. Effective and safe medical treatment depends on good communication between the healthcare team and patient. Cultural competence is an important component of patient safety. Full buy-in from the organization’s senior decision-makers is essential to the success of any cultural competency initiative.
Cross and colleagues defined cultural competence as “a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes and policies that come together in a system, agency, or amongst professionals and enables that system, agency and those professionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations.”65(p iv) Lack of cultural competence affects healthcare and patient safety.
p. 85
p. 86
Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) comprise 8.6% of the U.S. population, or 25 million people.66 Patients with LEP have increased risk for adverse events. Divi et al.67 found that 49.1% of LEP patients experienced physical harm compared with the 29.5% of non-LEPs. In addition, LEP patients experienced higher levels of physical harm (46.8%) compared with their non-LEP counterparts (24.4%). Communication is the third most common root cause of sentinel events and unexpected events, which cause death or serious physical or psychological injury.68
Because of inequities, individuals across the United States are unable to reach their optimal health potential. Inequities in healthcare are influenced by “social determinants of health, or those conditions in which individuals are born, grow, live, work and age.”69(¶1) One of the most modifiable factors is the lack of CLAS, broadly defined as “care and services that are respectful of and responsive to the cultural and linguistic needs of all individuals.”70(¶1) Various models are proposed to describe cultural competence as a patient-­centered approach. All the models have these dimensions in common: knowledge (e.g., understanding the meaning of culture and its importance to healthcare delivery), attitudes (e.g., having respect for variations in cultural norms), and skills (e.g., eliciting the patient’s explanatory models of illness).71(p2)
The National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care—the National CLAS Standards—were originally released in 2001 and updated in 2013.70,72 The 15 National CLAS Standards are intended to advance health equity, improve quality, and help eliminate healthcare disparities by establishing a blueprint for health and healthcare organizations to achieve equity. These standards are increasingly recognized as effective for improving quality of care, patient safety, effectiveness, and patient centeredness.70(p17) The Standards and actions that an organization might consider to improve patient safety and cultural competency are shown in TABLE 2-4.
Table 2-4 The National CLAS Standards and Patient Safety
CLAS Standard
Actions/Interventions
Principal Standard
1.Provide effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs.
•Create a more welcoming, safe and inclusive environment that contributes to improved healthcare quality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients and their families (The Joint Commission, 2011).
•Negotiating an understanding within which a safe, effective, and mutually agreeable treatment plan can be implemented.
Governance, Leadership, and Workforce
2.Advance and sustain organizational governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity through policy, practices, and allocated resources.
•Ensure diversity to reflect shifting demographics and populations served in the composition of the C-Suite executives and Board of Directors to diversity of thought, experience, and background in organization’s management and Boardroom.
•Create policy whereby interpreters must be provided to patients and/or family members when obtaining informed consent, having discussion about advance healthcare directives, gathering critical clinical information (e.g., patient’s medical history), explaining the plan of care (e.g., procedures), and providing updates on the treatment plan (e.g., discharge planning, care transitions).
3.Recruit, promote, and support a culturally and linguistically diverse governance, leadership, and workforce that are responsive to the population in the service area.
•Advertise for vacancies through targeted publications (e.g., the Institute for Diversity in Healthcare).
•Develop a board recruitment strategy so the Board is representative of the community.
4.Educate and train governance, leadership, and workforce in culturally and linguistically appropriate policies and practices on an ongoing basis.
•Supply clinicians with current information regarding susceptibility of particular racial/ethnic groups to certain diseases and conditions and possible lifestyles and dietary habits that impact health or make it difficult for patients to follow treatment plans.
•Create core curriculum on cultural competence in healthcare to Improve the safety and quality for onboarding new board members and staff.
•Improve the ability of clinicians to communicate effectively with their patients directly or via interpreters through training in the following:
1.Communication skills (including how to effectively negotiate a treatment plan which the patient will be able and willing to follow)
2.Cultural awareness (understanding and acceptance of beliefs and lifestyles different from their own).
Communication and Language Assistance
5.Offer language assistance to individuals who have LEP and/or other communication needs, at no cost to them, to facilitate timely access to all healthcare and services.
•Readily available interpreters in the Emergency Department for LEP patients to avoid delays in care resulting in adverse consequences in the absence of any language assistance service.
•Use Ask Me 3 from NPSF for information and resources to educate patients and providers about health literacy and improving patient-provider communication.
6.Inform all individuals of the availability of language assistance services clearly and in their preferred language, verbally and in writing.
•Signage in public areas describing the organization’s language assistance services and how to access interpretation services.
•Provide information about language assistance services in admission packets for ambulatory, emergency and acute care.
7.Ensure the competence of individuals providing language assistance, recognizing that the use of untrained individuals and/or minors as interpreters should be avoided.
•Interpreter certification through oral and written proficiency tests of their knowledge of conversational and medical language in both English and the language of interpretation. Untrained interpreters may lack knowledge of medical terminology and confidentiality. Untrained interpreters are more likely to commit errors in interpretation that can lead to adverse clinical consequences.
•The presence of interpreters may inhibit discussions of sensitive issues, such as domestic violence, substance use, psychiatric illness, and sexual activity.
8.Provide easy-to-understand print and multimedia materials and signage in the languages commonly used by the populations in the service area.
•Create an indexed resource library of educational materials in threshold and/or preferred languages of patient populations served. Integrate with electronic health record if technology permits.
•Use digital health products such as customized medication instruction programs that provide easy-to-understand, ethnically appropriate medical information on prescribed medications and access to videos that demonstrate how to take medications prescribed.
•Develop a shared vocabulary.
Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability
9.Establish culturally and linguistically appropriate goals, policies, and management accountability, and infuse them throughout the organization’s planning and operations.

•Form a Diversity Council or Committee to oversee the implementation of the cultural competency program.
•Include cultural competency as a clearly stated focus in quality plans with measures and goals to evaluate success and progress.
10.Conduct ongoing assessments of the organization’s CLAS-related activities and integrate CLAS-related measures into measurement and continuous quality improvement activities.
•Conduct an annual organizational cultural competency assessment using an established tool.
•Self-audit for cultural and linguistic competency prior to embarking upon a cultural competency initiative. Include items related to safety such as incident reporting and use of interpreters.
•Develop a Disparities Dashboard.
11.Collect and maintain accurate and reliable demographic data to monitor and evaluate the impact of CLAS on health equity and outcomes and to inform service delivery.
•Create standardized screening, admission and intake forms that reflect CLAS-driven demographic data.
•Collect data on race and ethnicity, county of origin, and language.

Leadership and Patient Safety
National pressures mount and new expectations emerge for healthcare leaders. These come from government agencies (e.g., CMS), public reporting groups (e.g., The Leapfrog Group and U.S. News & World Report), accreditation agencies (e.g., TJC and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education), and third-party payers. Third-party payers are using the practice of nonpayment for certain reasonably preventable conditions (e.g., pressure ulcers) and serious preventable events (e.g., leaving a sponge in a patient during surgery).

Leaders are responsible for driving change and improvement in patient safety practices that address these pressures and expectations. A patient safety practice is “a type of process or structure whose application reduces the probability of adverse events resulting from exposure to the healthcare system across a range of diseases and procedures”73(p13) Applicability of various safety practices is dependent upon many factors, including the healthcare setting, the populations served, high-risk processes, volume-driven practices, and previous performance data. Organizations can use quality tools such as a prioritization matrix to select safety standards relevant to their populations served.
Leadership works with others in the organization to prioritize needs, select practices for improvement, allocate resources to successfully implement patient safety practices, and ensure commitment to interventions and improvement are sustained over time. The governing board and medical leadership participate in the analysis and prioritization process. Patient safety practices are integrated into the organization’s strategic direction. Goals are developed that are both realistic and aspirational. Various national organizations employ consensus-driven processes to identify patient safety practices to be adopted by healthcare organizations. Because there is now an abundance of consensus-driven standards, healthcare quality professionals can look to the tried and true work of others to develop their own safety practices. For example, recommendations can be found in Safe Practices for Better Healthcare: 2010 Update.74 These are summarized in TABLE 2-5.
Table 2-5 Safe Practices for Better Healthcare—2010 Update
Safe Practice
Practice Statement
Safe Practice 1: Leadership Structures
and Systems
Leadership structures and systems must be established to ensure organization-wide awareness of patient safety performance gaps, direct accountability of leaders for those gaps, and adequate investment in performance improvement abilities, and that actions are taken to ensure safe care of every patient served.
Safe Practice 2: Culture Measurement, Feedback, and Intervention
Healthcare organizations must measure their culture, provide feedback to the leadership and staff, and undertake interventions that will reduce patient safety risk.
Safe Practice 3: Teamwork Training and Skill Building
Healthcare organizations must establish a proactive, systematic, organization-wide approach to developing team-based care through teamwork training, skill building, and team-led performance improvement interventions that reduce preventable harm to patients.
Safe Practice 4: Identification and Mitigation of Risks and Hazards
Healthcare organizations must systematically identify and mitigate patient safety risks and hazards with an integrated approach to continuously drive down preventable patient harm.
Safe Practice 5: Informed Consent
Ask each patient or legal surrogate to “teach back,” in his or her own words, key information about the proposed treatments or procedures for which he or she is being asked to provide informed consent.
Safe Practice 6: Life-Sustaining Treatment
Ensure that written documentation of the patient’s preferences for life-sustaining treatments is prominently displayed in his or her chart.
Safe Practice 7: Disclosure
Following serious unanticipated outcomes, including those that are clearly caused by systems failures, the patient and, as appropriate, the family should receive timely, transparent, and clear communication concerning what is known about the event.
Safe Practice 8: Care of the Caregiver
Following serious unintentional harm resulting from systems failures and/or errors that resulted from human performance failures, the involved caregivers (clinical providers, staff, and administrators) should receive timely and systematic care to include: treatment that is just, respect, compassion, supportive medical care, and the opportunity to fully participate in event investigation and risk identification and mitigation activities that will prevent future events.
Safe Practice 9: Nursing Workforce
Implement critical components of a well-designed nursing workforce that mutually reinforce patient safeguards, including the following:
•a nurse staffing plan with evidence that it is adequately resourced and actively managed and its effectiveness is regularly evaluated with respect to patient safety;
•senior administrative nursing leaders, such as a chief nursing officer, are part of the hospital senior management team;
•governance boards and senior administrative leaders that take accountability for reducing patient safety risks related to nurse staffing decisions and the provision of financial resources for nursing services; and
•provision of budgetary resources to support nursing staff in the ongoing acquisition and maintenance of professional knowledge and skills.
Safe Practice 10: Direct Caregivers
Ensure that non-nursing direct care staffing levels are adequate, that staff are competent, and that they have had adequate orientation, training, and education to perform their assigned direct care duties.
Safe Practice 11: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Care
All patients in general ICU (both adult and pediatric) should be managed by physicians who have specific training and certification in critical care medicine (“critical care certified”).
Safe Practice 12: Patient Care Information
Ensure that care information is transmitted and appropriately documented in a timely manner and in a clearly understandable form to patients and all of the patient’s healthcare providers/professionals within and between care settings who need that information to provide continued care.
Safe Practice 13: Order Read Back and Abbreviations
Incorporate within your organization a safe, effective communication strategy, structures, and systems to include the following:
•For verbal or telephone orders or for telephonic reporting of critical test results, verify the complete order or test result by having the person who is receiving the information record and “read back” the complete order or test result.
•Standardize a list of “do not use” abbreviations, acronyms, symbols, and dose designations that cannot be used throughout the organization.
Safe Practice 14: Labeling of Diagnostic Studies

As part of its duties, the governing body or board of directors holds accountability for quality of care and patient safety. The heightened attention to public reporting affects this responsibility. Quality oversight is recognized more clearly as a core fiduciary duty, which is the highest standard of care. This is not just financial health and reputation. Accountability for quality and safety cannot be fully delegated to the medical staff and executive leadership. A purpose- and values-driven board, in partnership with executive leadership and medical staff, set performance expectations to elimination of harm while mitigating risks.
Quality and safety contribute to financial stability and offer capital opportunities for growing healthcare organizations.

As decisions are made about bond ratings, agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service stress the importance of the healthcare leader’s attention to clinical quality outcomes and safety
From a credit perspective, a not-for-profit hospital’s focus on a quality agenda can translate into improved ratings through increased volume and market share, operational efficiencies, better rates from commercial payers, and improved financial performance. Like many strategies, [Moody’s] recognize[s] that realizing financial returns from a quality strategy may require large capital costs and incurred operating losses in the short term. However, over the long term, a hospital’s focus on quality will be viewed as a credit positive if greater patient demand and financial improvements materialize. Many not-for-profit hospitals are launching strategies to improve evidence-based clinical outcomes and patient safety, which we view as the two key facets of a strategy aimed at improving quality. The effort to improve quality is a major component of most hospitals’ mission to provide the best patient care possible.75(p1)
These perspectives are critical to the conversations about the business case for quality and safety.
When providing quality care and reducing harm as part of an organization’s strategy, the board, executives, and medical staff have the opportunity for continual, transparent, and data-informed deliberations about capital and human resource investments. And in doing so, consider harm and its impact on the bottom-line. This criticality was underscored by a recent Moody’s report on for-profit and not-for-profit hospital performance whereby
technological innovation in healthcare will likely lead to lower patient volumes at both for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. However, for hospitals at the forefront of healthcare technology, the benefits of innovation will outweigh the reduction in volumes. Telemedicine and remote monitoring, particularly for high-risk populations, will reduce emergency room visits and inpatient admissions because they will improve preventative care. These technologies will also reduce hospital visits by making it more clear when a patient can be effectively managed at home (e.g., heart-burn vs heart attack). Further, advances in medical technologies and minimally invasive surgeries will also lead to more procedures being done in lower-cost settings, such as physician offices or ambulatory service centers, rather than in hospitals. . . . Technological improvements in medical equipment, handheld devices, and electronic health records will also reduce medical errors, which are costly in many ways (including payment penalties, higher insurance and litigation costs).76(p4)
Investments in technology that reduce medical errors or more effective care management, also contribute to the hospital or healthcare system’s financial stability and growth. Better care, smarter spending, healthier people.
Patient safety must be integrated by leadership into strategic planning. Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)77 outlines six things all boards can consider in their effort to improve quality and reduce harm:
1.Learning, starting with the board: Develop capability as a board. Learn how the best boards work with executives and physician leaders to reduce harm. Set an expectation for similar levels of education and training for all staff.
2.Establishing executive accountability: Oversee the effective execution of a plan to achieve aims to reduce harm, including executive team accountability for clear performance improvement targets.
3.Setting aims: Set a specific aim to reduce harm this year. Make an explicit public commitment to measurable quality improvement (e.g., a reduction in unnecessary mortality and harm), establishing a clear aim for the facility or system.
4.Establishing and monitoring system-level measures: Identify a small group of organization-wide measures of patient safety (e.g., facility-wide harm, risk-adjusted mortality), update the measures continually, and make them transparent to the entire organization and customers.
5.Gathering data and hearing stories: Select and review progress toward safer care as the first agenda item at every board meeting; progress is grounded in transparency and a desire to put a human face on harm data.
6.Changing the environment, policies, and culture: Commit to establishing and maintaining an environment that is respectful, fair, and just for all who experience pain and loss because of avoidable harm and adverse outcomes.
With the convergence of clinical care, safety priorities, and economic stability, board members’ interest will increase over time and create opportunities for healthcare quality professionals to educate organizational leaders on the importance of attending to patient safety. “Board oversight of quality and patient safety rests on the directors’ ability to obtain, process, and interpret information; assess current performance; and set strategic direction using a range of metrics tailored to local circumstances.”78(p754)
Over 100 consensus standards with a focus on patient safety are endorsed by NQF. The first of the 34 endorsed practices are Leadership Structures and Systems.79 This safe practice for leadership provides an overview of the leadership structures and systems deemed critical to the organization-wide awareness of patient safety performance gaps, direct accountability of leaders for those gaps, and adequate investment in performance improvement abilities, along with the actions necessary to ensure safe care of every patient served.74 The four distinct elements within the NQF-endorsed safe practice of Leadership Structures and Systems are outlined below.
p. 92
p. 93
Awareness Structures and Systems
Awareness structures and systems provide leaders with continuous information about potential risks, hazards, and performance gaps that may contribute to patient safety issues. These structures and systems include (a) identification of risks and hazards; (b) culture management, feedback, and intervention; (c) direct patient input; and (d) governance board and senior management briefings and meetings.
Accountability Structures and Systems
Accountability structures and systems enable leaders to establish direct accountability to the governing body, senior management, mid-level management, physician leaders, and frontline staff. Included in these structures and systems are (a) the patient safety program, (b) the patient safety officer, (c) direct organization-wide leadership accountability, (d) an interdisciplinary patient safety committee, and (e) external reporting activities.
Structures and Systems-Driving Ability
Structures and systems-driving ability allows leaders to assess the capacity, resources, and competence necessary to implement change in the culture and in patient safety performance. This ability includes (a) patient safety budgets, (b) people systems, (c) quality systems, and (d) technical systems.
Action Structures and Systems
Action structures and systems enable leaders to take direct and appropriate action. These structures and systems include (a) quality and performance improvement programs; (b) regular actions of governance, including confirmation of values, basic teamwork training, and governance board competence in patient safety; (c) regular actions of senior administrative leadership, including commitment of time to patient safety; culture measurement, feedback, and interventions; basic teamwork training and team interventions; and identification and mitigation of risks and hazards; (d) regular actions of unit, service line, departmental and mid-level management leaders; and (e) regular actions with respect to independent medical leaders.74(pp6–10)
As leaders think about accountability and action, they can foster and reward improvement for the spread of best practices, knowledge and adoption of value-based interventions and innovations in program design and redesign. Measures of success should align the incentives for the improvement of patient safety. Rogers’s work on disseminating innovations is also applicable to the widespread adoption of safety practices.80 A comprehensive discussion of change and innovation can be found in Performance and Process Improvement. Also, see Organizational Leadership for more information about leadership, quality improvement, and strategy.
Patient Safety Principles and Practices
Human error is inevitable, even among the most conscientious professionals who are practicing the highest standards of care. Human error happens when “there is general agreement that the individual should have done other than what they did, and in the course of that conduct inadvertently causes or could cause an undesirable outcome, the individual is labeled as having committed an error.”81(p6) Identification and reporting of human error events are critical to an organization’s efforts to continuously improve patient safety and contribute to a robust learning environment. Likewise, healthcare leaders have a duty to recognize the inevitability of human error, design systems that make such error less likely, and avoid punitive reactions to honest errors. Pham et al.82 offer that IRS can help the organization identify local system hazards, bolster the patient safety culture, and share lessons within and across organizations. Incident reporting, however, should not be the only component of an enterprise-wide patient safety program.
A formal patient safety program is part of system design. The program considers the following:
•Mission, vision, core values, and goals of the organization
•Interrelationships between and among functions, departments and disciplines
•Acknowledging differences in the patient safety mindset
•Silos that might exist for overlapping or misaligned goals and objectives
•Forming cross-departmental teams for collaboration
•Identifying where processes can be streamlined to improve organizational or system effectiveness.
The written program and plan incorporates the patient safety goals and objectives. It describes how efforts are coordinated to support organization-wide assessment, evaluation, and improvement of interrelated processes. Different aspects of the plan can include the following:
•Governance and leadership
•Goals and objectives
•Planning, designing, and redesigning safe processes
•Culture of safety
•Reduction of preventable errors (e.g., identifying and mitigating risks and hazards, adverse events, sentinel events, and peer review processes)
•Adherence to clinical practice guidelines
•Patient, family, and caregiver engagement
p. 93
p. 94
•Measurement, monitoring, and evaluating program effectiveness/success
•Transparency and dissemination of results across the organization.
The healthcare quality professional can guide the organization in determining which performance improvement methodology can be adopted proactively and retrospectively. An organization also can look to build the skills of those working on improving patient safety, such as avowing common pitfalls when conducting a root cause analysis (RCA)83 and developing strong harm reduction actions that are sustainable.
Harm Reduction
The IOM report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System,21 and its subsequent reports, garnered the attention of providers, payers, and consumers by illustrating the direct relationship between quality of care and patient outcomes. Further, Becher and Chassin84 pointed out the experience of patient harm as the result of three types of quality issues: underuse, overuse, and misuse of health services. Underuse occurs when patients do not receive beneficial health services. For instance, only 10% of patients who have an addiction problem receive treatment.85 Overuse occurs when patients undergo treatment or procedures from which they do not benefit (e.g., X-rays performed on patients with back pain are unnecessary). Misuse occurs when patients receive appropriate medical services provided poorly, adding to the risk for preventable complications.
Underuse, overuse, and misuse are considered waste and waste is costly. Berwick and Hackbarth86 believe the best healthcare reform and cost reduction strategy is to eliminate waste. They identified six categories where considerable costs are represented by waste. Below are the categories and the estimated wasteful spending to the U.S. healthcare system. Total waste cost of the United States was $558 billion to $1,263 billion in 2011. These are examples of waste related to harm reduction:
1.Failures of care delivery: Waste from poor execution or lack of best practice adoption resulting in injuries and poor outcomes ($102 billion to $154 billion).
2.Failures of care coordination: Waste related to fragmented care resulting in complications, readmissions, declines in functional status, and increased dependency of the chronically ill ($25 billion to $45 billion).
3.Overtreatment: Waste from rendering care that is not useful ($158 billion to $226 billion).
Human Factors
Human factors (also called human factors engineering) “is the application of knowledge about human capabilities (physical, sensory, emotional, and intellectual) and limitations to the design and development of tools, devices, systems, environments, and organizations. . . .”87(p1) The human factors associated with healthcare personnel and patient safety are complex. Employee attitudes, motivation, physical and psychological health, education, training, and cognitive functioning can influence the likelihood of a medical error.
In healthcare, 85% of errors are the result of systems issues, and 15% are attributable to human factors.88 According to IHI, “The key to reliable, safe care does not lie in exhorting individuals to be more careful and try harder. It lies in learning about causes of error and designing systems to prevent human error whenever possible.”77(p19) Causes for human error are important in system design and redesign. Examples of human factors found to contribute to errors include the following:
•Human interaction with machines
•Workload leading to errors and mistakes in providing the best care for patients, when there are not enough staff to handle the workload or work hours are inadequate
•Disruptive behavior of healthcare personnel that undermines a culture of patient safety89
•Fatigue and stress leading to less than expected performance.90(p100)
Any improvement efforts focused on eliminating errors requires a just culture, detailed analysis of the care delivery process, human factors influencing processes of care, and the resources to bring about sustained system change. Drawing from many other disciplines such as anatomy, physiology, physics, biomechanics, and ergonomics, the IHI defines human factors as “the study of all the factors that make it easier to do the work in the right way”91(¶1) The science applied to healthcare fosters these principles in designed work processes:
•Simplify to take steps out of a process.
•Standardize to remove variation and promote predictability and consistency.
•Use forcing functions and constraints that makes it impossible to do a task incorrectly and creates a hard stop that cannot be passed unless actions are changed. Check, restrict, or compel to avoid or perform some action.
•Use redundancies such as double-checking someone’s work.
•Avoid reliance on memory by using tools such as checklists.
•Take advantage of habits and patterns to perform consistently (habit) and in a recognizable way (pattern).
•Promote effective team functioning (e.g., teamwork and communication).
•Automate and use technology carefully.91
High Reliability
Healthcare organizations and systems are working toward becoming highly reliable. As Gordon et al.92 pointed out, to
p. 94
p. 95
become a high-reliability ­industry healthcare “needs a radical cultural transformation, like the one that has taken place in aviation over the past thirty years. . . . If aviation could do it, health care can too.”92(p7) Adopting high-reliability principles and practices helps the healthcare organization strive toward a near-zero-defect culture. ­Reason45 stated: “Perhaps the most important distinguishing feature of high reliability organizations is their collective preoccupation with the possibility of failure. They expect to make errors and train their workforce to recognize and recover them.”45(p770)
HROs are “organizations with systems in place that are exceptionally consistent in accomplishing their goals and avoiding catastrophic errors.”93,94(p298) Five key concepts frame the HRO. They include the following:
1.Sensitivity to operations. Preserving constant awareness and vigilance by leaders and staff about the state of the systems and processes affecting patient care. This awareness is central to noting risks and preventing them.
2.Reluctance to simplify. Simple processes are good, but simplistic explanations for why things work or fail are risky. Avoiding overly simple explanations of failure (unqualified staff, inadequate training, communication failure, etc.) is essential to understand the true reasons patients are placed at risk.
3.Preoccupation with failure. When near misses occur, these are viewed as evidence of systems to improve for reduction of potential harm to patients. Rather than viewing near misses as proof the system has effective safeguards, they are viewed as symptomatic of areas in need of more attention.
4.Deference to expertise. If leaders and supervisors are not willing to listen and respond to the insights of staff who know how processes work and the risks patients face, high reliability in the organization’s safety culture may not be possible.
5.Resilience. Leaders and staff need to be trained and prepared to know how to respond when system failures do occur.95(p1)
These concepts lead to mindfulness, an important component of reliability, which keep HROs at a high level of vigilance.95(p7) Chassin and Loeb96(p481) propose organizations use robust process improvement, “a combination of Lean, Six Sigma, and change management” as a new set of tools to achieve high reliability and maintain patient safety. These can achieve outcomes such as decreased morbidity and mortality through the application of replicable and scalable patient safety interventions. Many organizations now use the Lean practice of system redesign with a focus on the human factors in their patient safety programs. See Performance and Process Improvement for more information on Lean and Six Sigma, and Organizational Leadership for more information on change management.
Weick and Sutcliffe97,98 explain the success of an HRO—by acting mindfully, an HRO organizes itself so the unexpected is noticed and stopped from advancing. Five principles are found to impact HRO performance and responsiveness:
1.Preoccupation with failure. Attention on close calls and near misses (“being lucky vs being good”); focus more on failures rather than successes.
2.Reluctance to simplify interpretations. Solid “root cause” analysis practices.
3.Sensitivity to operations. Situational awareness and carefully designed change management processes.
4.Commitment to resilience. Resources are continually devoted to corrective action plans and training.
5.Deference to expertise. Listen to the experts on the frontlines (e.g., authority follows expertise).
Using these principles, the healthcare quality professional can work with others in the organization to create a mindful infrastructure that prevents harm from happening, reduces the damage produced by unexpected events, and promotes reliable performance.
Marx has been working with high reliability in the context of a just culture for over 20 years and offered that “it is through the lessons of our everyday errors that we can design our work environment.”81(p3) High reliability is dependent on making good choices and becoming less error prone and more error tolerant. Marx works from a model-based approach to managing risk proactive or anticipatory) instead of an event-driven approach (reactive). The focus on highly reliable outcomes derives from a core set of principles99 that include the following:
•Zero is not possible.
•There is no such thing as an HRO; there are only organizations that are highly reliable around those things they value.
•Humans are not inherently rule followers—they are threat and hazards avoiders.
•There is a preoccupation with risk. Faulty equipment and fallible human beings can still produce great results.
•Strive to be three human errors away from harm with robust system design.
•It is about system design and choices and managing the right things.
•Doing less is often the better path—adopt smart designs that are often less extensive.
An example of system design and redesign is the Lean Healthcare program developed and deployed by Hagg et al.100 for different initiatives. The program strategy enabled the robust implementation of quality and performance improvement initiatives including clinical practice bundles. See FIGURE 2-4 for techniques and methodologies used. The program applied Lean and systems engineering methodologies and was
p. 95
p. 96
structured to sustain improvements in process effectiveness and patient outcomes. The idea is to build sustainable programs as when change is frequent or not sustained, the result is often accompanied by increased staff fatigue, a more stressful work environment, and increased costs.100(p1) Different projects were successfully implemented that affected patient safety such as emergency department patient flow, surgical flow, medication delivery process redesign, ICU length of stay reduction (including ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]/­glycemic control bundles), central line and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus bundles, and patient fall reduction. Mitigating risk by using proven techniques contributes to high reliability—whether it is the behavior of the organization or the outcomes that result from the organization’s processes.

Another example of system design for infection prevention and control is the “Journey to Zero” that includes innovative strategies to eradicate HAIs through a process of laying the foundation (sizing the burden), crafting a multipronged strategy (establishing frontline awareness and minimizing pathogen opportunity), and ensuring sustainable success and promoting long-term gains.14(pp18–19) Hand hygiene is an example of where the principles of high reliability bring promise. To get to zero HAIs, the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare developed a Hand Hygiene Targeted Solutions Tool to manage change so it can be sustained using principles of leadership, safety culture, and performance improvement.101 Many organizations use this tool to increase hand hygiene.
Risk Management
In the 1970s, RM was the initial reaction to continually increasing litigation. However, as litigation continued to rise, RM assumed a more proactive role in reducing the incidents of unsafe care. Today, healthcare organizations focus on maintaining good and defined standards of practice to identify hazards posing risks to patients, assess the risks associated with healthcare hazards against the intended benefit, and eliminate or reduce risks to patients.102 TABLE 2-6 summarizes how approaches and processes of healthcare risk management (HRM) have evolved.

RM is the process of making and carrying out decisions that will minimize the adverse effects of accidental losses. Whereas the traditional evolution demonstrates a strong focus on clinical HRM, the concept of enterprise risk management is becoming more popular in expanding the focus of risks that affect the entire organization, not just clinical operations. In 2010, Carroll noted that “Enterprise risk management (ERM) is a comprehensive business decision-making process instituted and supported by the healthcare organization’s board, executive management, and medical staff leadership. ERM recognizes the synergistic effect of risks across the continuum of care, and has as its goals to reduce uncertainty and process variability, promote patient safety and maximize the return on investment through asset preservation, and the recognition of actionable risk opportunities.”103(p585) The major categories of risk in ERM include the following:
•Strategic: Brand and reputational risks associated with business strategy, changing priorities, and competition;
•Financial: Risks that affect the profitability, cash flow access to capital, or financial ratings;
•Legal and regulatory: Risks associated with licensure, accreditation, product liability, and intellectual property issues;
•Operational: Risks related to the business operation that may result from failed processes, people, or systems;
•Human capital: Risks associated with a tight labor market, including selection, retention, and compensation;
•Technology: Risks associated with machines, equipment, devices, hardware, and software; and

•Hazard: risks related to physical loss of assets, often associated with natural hazards such as earthquakes, wildfire, cyclonic storms, flood, and drought.
In 2014, Carroll furthered the definition of ERM in healthcare as a “comprehensive framework for making RM decisions which maximize value protection and creation by managing risk and uncertainty and their connection to total value.”104(p5) ERM includes components of culture, strategy, objectives, appetite/tolerance, structure and plans, and oversight:
•Culture: A culture supporting ERM, including programs such as HROs, Crew Resource Management, Just Culture, and Mindfulness.
•Strategy: Management’s game plan for strengthening enterprise performance, with an organizational strategy linked to vision, mission, goals and objectives.
•Objectives: Ensuring ERM objectives are SMART—specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely.
•Appetite/Tolerance: Determining the desired level of risk the organization will take vis-à-vis its mission and threshold or qualitative range of risks taken in pursuit of the organization’s strategy (i.e., tolerance).
•Structure and Plans: Organization-wide communication and education plans describe key roles and committee structures, employee engagement strategies, techniques to update employees on the progress of ERM initiatives,

p. 98
key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs), and scenarios highlighting the value of ERM to the organization.
•Oversight: Acknowledging the responsibility of the Governing Body for ERM oversight; leadership ensures the Governing Body is regularly apprised of: progress on risk strategies, status of KPIs and KRIs, emerging risks and recommendations for new projects.104(pp6–8)
Risk and Quality
Effective strategies for proactively reducing errors and ensuring patient safety require an integrated and coordinated approach to synthesizing knowledge and experience. Staff members are encouraged to learn about errors and permit internal reporting of information without blame. There are interdependencies and intersections between healthcare quality and RM. Healthcare quality professionals work in tandem with enterprise RM to
•improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization’s processes and operations through consistent identification of risks (threats) to the enterprise;
•identify, evaluate, and prioritize areas of risk affecting the operations of the organization;
•assess whether the identified risks are caused by internal (controllable) or external (uncontrollable) factors;
•develop and propose comprehensive strategies to minimize risks;
•establish action plans to address problems when identified; and
•maintain a periodic evaluation of feedback to monitor the progress of strategies and actions.
HRM can be defined as an “organized effort to identify, assess, and reduce, where appropriate, risk to patients, visitors, staff and organizational assets.”105(p3) The goal of HRM in any organization is to protect from financial losses, which may arise because of the risks to which it is exposed. A healthcare risk manager must consider such things as regulatory compliance, safety management, credentialing, client–provider relations, publicity and media coverage, and, most importantly, patient care. In this way, HRM and patient safety are closely aligned.
Key to ERM program management is the risk manager. This position is an important asset to the organization and is typically charged with functions related to risk identification, risk assessment and evaluation, and application of techniques to reduce risks. Duties vary widely by organization, but the basic ERM functions are as follows:
•Risk identification, assessment, planning, mitigation, and evaluation;
•Maintenance and monitoring of effective incident reporting and occurrence screen programs;
•Clinical and administrative responsibilities, such as regulatory compliance, policy review, credentialing, contract review, internal and external reporting, and education;
•Collaboration and communication with environmental safety officer, patient safety officer, and quality officer (although not optimal, in some organizations these are the same position);
•Collaboration with the financial officer on insurance and other risk financing methods; and
•Collaboration and communication with legal representatives for claims management.
The risk manager is often charged with developing and deploying the ERM plan to align patient safety efforts so RM activities are not siloed. It is helpful for risk managers to also have some experience and knowledge in these areas: clinical knowledge because they must review care and provide guidance to clinical providers of care; knowledge of healthcare law and thorough understanding of the legal system because review is necessary of defense counsel work and legal documents; knowledge about the insurance industry because risk managers help make decisions about various insurance coverages, such as hospital professional liability, general liability, and workers’ compensation.
Risk Management Plan. A healthcare organization typically has a formal, written plan explaining its ERM philosophy. Often the ERM plan is integrated with the quality and patient safety plan because the processes are interdependent. Important plan elements include purpose and board statement of support of ERM, scope of the program, authority, and confidentiality assertions, data collection and reporting mechanisms (both internal and external) and integration with quality management and program effectiveness reviews. Within the plan, prevention of risk is often managed by
•contract review
•internal and external reporting processes
•education of staff and providers
•policy review to protect the organization
•informed consent.
Possible causes of losses for organizations related to patient safety include criminal acts by employees, patient harm related to inability of contractors to perform services, clinical treatment by qualified or unqualified staff, falls with injury, and medication errors with harm. An important aspect of enterprise RM is management of claims. TABLE 2-7 lists the types of professional liability sources often considered in determining the validity of a claim.
Table 2-7 Professional Liability Sources
Corporate liability
Based on recognition that the organization owes a duty to the patients it serves
Vicarious liability
Indirect responsibility for the acts of another person; respondeat superior, which holds the employer responsible for the wrongful acts of its employees
Ostensible agency
Generally an organization is not liable for injuries sustained by patients because of the actions of an independent contractor. However, the extension of respondeat superior to the doctrine of the ostensible agency may extend liability exposure to the organization for acts of nonemployed, independent contractor physicians where no employer–employee relationship exists.
Res ipsa loquitur
Allows a patient to prove his or her case without needing to establish the standard of care in which there is clear and obvious negligence
p. 98
p. 99
Risk Assessment
Organizations can establish mechanisms for reviewing potential incidents of risk and safety concern. All members of the workforce are responsible for identifying, reporting, and documenting RM and potential quality-of-care problems that influence patient safety. Variance or incident reporting is an important component of any patient safety program. Healthcare quality professionals assist organizations in developing and maintaining IRS. AHRQ106 describes four attributes of voluntary patient safety event reporting systems:
1.Institution must have a supportive environment for event reporting to protect the privacy of staff who report occurrences.
2.Reports are received from a broad range of personnel.
3.Summaries of reported events must be disseminated in a timely fashion.
4.A structured mechanism must be in place for reviewing reports and developing action plans.106(¶2)
Only a small portion of healthcare errors (10% to 20%) is reported. Of the errors reported, 90% to 95% result in no harm to the patient.107 A report of the DHHS Office Inspector General108 found “most incidents of patient harm were not being reported. Hospital staff did not report 86 percent of events to incident reporting systems, partly because of staff misperceptions about what constitutes patient harm. Of the events experienced by Medicare beneficiaries discharged in October 2008, hospital incident reporting systems captured only an estimated 14 percent.”(108pii)
Fear of disciplinary action continues to affect reporting practices by healthcare personnel.109 Frequent and routine reporting is more likely in organizations with nonpunitive cultures. The AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture showed only 45% of staff feel their mistakes and event reports are not held against them and mistakes are not kept in their personnel file110; this rate has been consistently low since 2012 (see TABLE 2-8).

Risk Identification
Risk identification is the first step to determine what risks can affect the achievement of organizational goals. Both formal and informal methods are used, and the risks may be internal or external to the organization. Approaches used include retrospective, concurrent, pre-interventional, and prospective. Approaches in risk identification are aimed to identify the root causes of risks for things that do go wrong (e.g., RCA) and possible modes by which these functions might fail to perform (e.g., FMEA). It may be “easier to identify all the factors that are critical to success, and then work backward to identify the things that can go wrong with each one.”111(p24)
Once the risks have been identified, the next step is to conduct a risk assessment to quantify the magnitude or severity of the risks, the exposure through possible results, frequency of occurrence, probability of the occurrence, and time to act. Through this analysis, the organization can determine RM techniques that can be applied to the exposures to mitigate loss, select the best RM technique for the situation, prioritize actions, identify resources needed, identify risk control and risk financing methods, implement the techniques, monitor the effectiveness of the technique, and trend and analyze results.

Risk Control
Usually risk control is managed through incident (or variance) reporting, occurrence screening, and claims management. Data that may be useful when trended or analyzed include
•liability and workers’ compensation;
•tort claims (duty, breach of duty, causation, and injury);
•malpractice coverage;
•incident reports and occurrence screens;
•review of records using criteria to note variations

⚬records that need more in-depth review,
⚬confirmation of the variation or absence of an untoward event,
⚬summary of data with trends, and
⚬patient complaints.
Disclosure of Errors
Disclosing errors to patients and families is becoming more common practice in healthcare organizations across the country, especially in the aftermath of the Josie King incident in Maryland. Disclosure as an important part of error discovery in contrast to tactics of the past, which sprang from fear and blame.74 A just culture supports the disclosure of successes and failures. Healthcare quality professionals typically are involved in the investigation of errors and work with quality management, enterprise RM, and legal professionals to determine a course of action. TABLE 2-10 outlines NQF consensus standards regarding the disclosure of error or injury to consumers.
Table 2-10 Consensus Standards Related to Disclosure of Error or Injury
Safe Practice 7: Disclosure
Following serious unanticipated outcomes, including those that are clearly caused by systems failures, the patient and, as appropriate, the family should receive timely, transparent, and clear communication concerning what is known about the event.74
•The types of serious unanticipated outcomes addressed by this practice include, at a minimum, sentinel events, serious reportable events, and any other unanticipated outcomes involving harm that require the provision of substantial additional care (such as diagnostic tests, therapeutic interventions, or increased length of stay) or that cause the loss of limb or function lasting seven days or longer.
•Organizations must have formal processes in place for disclosing unanticipated outcomes, reporting events to those responsible for patient safety, including external organizations where applicable, and identifying and mitigating risks and hazards.
•The governance and administrative leadership should ensure that such information is systematically used for performance improvement by the organization. Policies and procedures should incorporate continuous quality improvement techniques and provide for annual reviews and updates.
•Adherence to the practice and participation with the support system is expected and may be considered as part of credentialing.
Applicable Clinical Care Settings
This practice is applicable to CMS care settings, to include ambulatory, ambulatory surgical center, emergency room, dialysis facility, home care, home health services/agency, hospice, inpatient service/hospital, outpatient hospital, and skilled nursing facility.
Communication with patients, their families and caregivers, should include or be characterized by the following:
•the “facts”—an explicit statement about what happened that includes an explanation of the implications of the unanticipated outcome for the patient’s future health, an explanation of why the event occurred, and information about measures taken for its preventability;
•empathic communication of the “facts,” a skill that should be developed and practiced in healthcare organizations;
•an explicit and empathic expression of regret that the outcome was not as expected (e.g., “I am sorry this has happened”);
•a commitment to investigate and as possible prevent future occurrences by collecting the facts about the event and providing them to the organization’s patient safety leaders, including those in governance positions;
•feedback of the results of the investigation, including whether or not it resulted from an error or systems failure, provided in sufficient detail to support informed decision-making by the patient;
•“timeliness”—the initial conversation with the patient and/or family occurs within 24 hours, whenever possible. Early and subsequent follow-up conversations occur, to maintain the relationship and to provide information as it becomes available;
•an apology from the patient’s licensed independent practitioner (LIP) and/or an administrative leader should be offered if the investigation reveals the adverse outcome clearly was caused by unambiguous errors or systems failures;
•emotional support for patients and their families provided by trained caregivers should be provided;
•a disclosure and improvement support system should be established and maintained to provide the following to caregivers and staff that includes
○emotional support for caregivers and administrators involved in such events provided by trained caregivers in the immediate post-event period that may extend for weeks afterward,
○education and skill building regarding the concepts, tools, and resources that produce optimal results from this practice, centered on systems improvement rather than blame, and with a special emphasis on creating a just culture,
○24-hour availability of advisory support to caregivers and staff to facilitate rapid responses to serious unanticipated outcomes, including the provision of “just-in-time” coaching and emotional support, and
○Education of caregivers regarding the importance and technique of disclosure to care teams of error or adverse events as they happen;
•healthcare organizations should implement a procedure to ensure and document that all LIPs are provided with a detailed description of the organization’s program for responding to adverse events, including the full disclosure of error(s) that may have caused or contributed to patient harm. This is done with the expectation that the healthcare organizations and/or the LIPs will provide this information to their individual medical malpractice liability carriers in the event that they are provided liability coverage from entities outside of the organization. All new employees should also receive this information;
•a process should be in place to consider providing information to a Patient Safety Organization that would provide a patient safety evaluation program to protect privileged and confidential information; and
•a process should be in place to consider early remediation and the waiving of billing for care services provided during the care episode and for subsequent treatment if the event was due to unambiguous systems failures or human error.

Conway et al. highlight the “respectful management” of adverse events. The aims of this group’s work were to
•encourage and help every organization to develop a clinical crisis management plan before they need to use it;
•provide an approach to integrating this plan into the organizational culture of quality and safety with a focus on patient- and family-centered care and fair and just treatment for staff; and
•provide organizations with a concise, practical resource to inform their efforts when a serious adverse event occurs in the absence of a clinical crisis management plan and/or culture of quality and safety.112(p4)
Organizations can look for ways to encourage reporting using innovations such as the “Good Catch Awards” at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, MD. This reporting system encourages every clinician to report situations in which patients are at risk and potentially lifesaving actions are warranted.113
Patient Safety Tools
Professionals who lead patient safety programs and initiatives know the importance of using the most current evidence-based information to inform design and implementation efforts. Effective tools and strategies for implementation support the advances and improvement understanding of risk factors associated with the different aspects of healthcare affecting the safe delivery of healthcare—health IT, adverse events reporting, risk identification, infection prevention and control, medication safety, physical plant, and environment of care to name a few. Using evidence-based tools can promote patient-centered care and accelerate positive changes in the patient safety culture. For example, Plan–Do–Study–Act may help implement sustainable improvement by using small tests of change. See Performance and Process Improvement and Health Data Analytics for more information about tools for evaluating and improving quality and safety.
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
A failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) can be used to develop safety program activities and provide continuous readiness for external surveys. It is a way for staff to be
p. 100
p. 101
p. 101
p. 102
proactive in their pursuit of quality and safety versus to being reactive; to imagine what could go wrong and correct any risk factors before errors occur. FMEA includes review of the following:
•Steps in the process
•Failure modes (What could go wrong?)
•Failure causes (Why would the failure happen?)
•Failure effects (What would be the consequences of each failure?).91(¶1)
FMEA and Healthcare FMEA are fully described in detail in Performance and Process Improvement.
Root Cause Analysis
Organizations use RCA to determine the cause of a variation in a process. Human, environmental, equipment, policy, and leadership system factors are explored in the analysis. The OPSC has developed an exceptional RCA Toolkit.114 It provides a framework for investigating adverse incidents and can be applied in any healthcare setting.
Organizations developing and maintaining robust healthcare safety programs are committed to the process of ongoing risk identification and prevention. Staff in these organizations are encouraged to identify potential errors and report any “near misses” or “close calls” or “good catches” that occur. Even when an event is not considered “reviewable,” the HRO conduct RCAs on these identified risks to prevent similar events in the future.
The National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF) developed a definitive guide on conducting RCAs.115 These guidelines have been endorsed by TJC and other public and private patient safety organizations. The guide provides teams with effective techniques to conduct comprehensive systematic reviews to develop strong and sustainable actions to prevent future occurrence. See FIGURE 2-5 for the NPSF Root Cause Analysis and Action (RCA2) Process.

Red Rules
Another safety practice—Red Rules—is used by highly reliable industries such as aviation and manufacturing, sparking interest for use in healthcare.116,117 Red Rules are those that must be followed to the letter. The most important aspect of a Red Rule is to empower all workers to speak up when a rule is not being followed and to stop the line, regardless of their position in the organization.118,119
When properly implemented, Red Rules foster a culture of safety because frontline workers will know they can stop the line when they notice potential hazards. The most important aspect of a Red Rule is its ability to “empower any worker to speak up when the rule is not being followed and to stop the line, regardless of rank or seniority.”119(p2) ISMP119 outlines what differentiates a Red Rule from other crucial rules such as policies and procedures:
•It must be possible and desirable for everyone to follow a Red Rule every time in a process under all circumstances (Red Rules do not contain verbiage such as “except when…” or “each breach will be assessed for appropriateness”).
•Anyone who notices the breach of the Rule has the authority and responsibility to stop further progress of patient care while protecting the patient or healthcare worker from harm.
•Managers and other leaders (including the board of trustees) always support the work stoppage, immediate rectification of the problem, and addressing the underlying reason for breaking the rule.
•People breaching the Red Rule are given an opportunity to support their behavioral choices and are then judged fairly based on the reasons for breaking the rule, regardless of rank and experience.
•There are few Red Rules, and they must be well understood and memorable.(119¶7)
Healthcare scenarios for which Red Rules can be beneficial include patient identification (using two identifiers before administering tests of any kind), sponge-count reconciliation, timeouts before an invasive procedure, timely alarm response, and correct labeling of specimens.
Newer to healthcare quality and safety, there is a mixed reception of Red Rules. Red Rules are part of a just culture although the way they are deployed could impact how they are received by affected personnel. There are circumstances where they are experienced as blaming and punitive, which is not aligned with a just culture. The way that Red Rules are deployed may not support trust and transparency. Jones and O’Connor120 examined four measures of patient safety culture among two groups of hospitals that completed the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture and compared hospitals that did or did not implement Red Rules as a patient safety strategy. The four measures were (1) staff perceptions of safety; (2) frequency of events reported; (3) number of events reported; and (4) staff perceptions of no punitive response. The study found that there were no differences in the four measures between those hospitals who used Red Rules and those who did not. The authors did suggest that Red Rules can be effective as part of a comprehensive strategy to improve patient safety when used within a commitment-based management style.
Red Rules can be used as a communication tool to support staff in following safety rules rather than a disciplinary action. If misused or poorly supported, they will not be effective and may even introduce patient risks if systems and processes are not in place to facilitate adherence to the Red Rule.118
Safety Checklists
A checklist is an algorithmic, evidence-based listing of actions to be performed with the goal of “no step forgotten.” Grounded in human factors engineering, checklists can shape the organizational and systematic thinking and behaviors in healthcare delivery. Checklists are found to
•improve communication,
•strengthen adherence with guidelines,
•improve human factors,
•reduce the incidence of adverse events, and
•decrease mortality and morbidity.121
Patient safety checklists “allow complex pathways of care to function with high reliability by giving users the opportunity to pause and take stock of their actions before proceeding to the next step.”122(¶1) Checklists can be developed for internal processes (surgical checklist) or can be consumer-­focused.123 Surgical checklists are the most commonly used, but other checklists are developed for safe childbirth, trauma care, and Pandemic H1N1122 and other patient safety events, such as blood clots and central line–associated blood stream infections. Recently, the CDC124 released its Checklist for Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs, which is recommended for facilities to systematically assess the core key elements, actions to ensure optimal antibiotic prescribing, and limiting the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.
Checklists are helpful in preparing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating workforce and environmental safety. Healthcare services can be directly or indirectly provided to individuals in a variety of settings (e.g., hospitals, clinics, emergency departments, home health, and skilled nursing facilities). There are many health and safety hazards that workers face across the different settings including blood-borne pathogens, potential drug exposures, respiratory hazards, ergonomic hazards, and workplace violence. There are accreditation standards, regulations and state, federal and local laws governing workplace safety. Checklists can support an organization’s workforce and environmental safety efforts. FIGURE 2-6 offers an example for blood-borne pathogens in residential care.

The following checklist is designed to assist with determining which OSHA standards apply to your practice/facility and assessing your current state of compliance. It includes the most common hazards found in residential facilities. However, there are a number of other potential safety and health hazards were not addressed. If the following hazards exist in your facility, please refer to OSHA’s Compliance Assistance eTool for long-term care facilities (https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/nursinghome/index.html), or contact your state’s OSHA Consultation Program for assistance:
•Ergonomic Hazards associated with patient handling;
•Slips, trips, and falls;
•Influenza;
•Tuberculosis;
•Emergency response hazards; and
•Latex allergies.

The facility has workplace policies in place to protect employees from occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials (OPIM). These policies must include:
Practicing universal precautions
Using safety engineered needles and sharps
Consideration and documentation of safety engineered sharps on an annual basis, including documented input from non-managerial staff with occupational exposure
Having sharps containers as close as possible to the immediate area where sharps are used, and routinely inspecting to ensure that they do not become overfilled
Place sharps containers in shower rooms
Disposable razors are placed in sharps container once used
Washing exposed skin following contact, and washing hands after glove removal
Having eyewash stations located within 10 seconds of where exposure is likely to occur
Using personal protective equipment (PPE) whenever exposure is possible. PPE should be provided at no cost to the employees, and should be suitably sized and impervious
Maintaining a sufficient supply of protective equipment necessary for day-to-day operations
Creating and following a documented housekeeping schedule for cleaning and disinfecting equipment and work surfaces that may become contaminated with blood or OPIM. The schedule should include frequency of activities and the registered disinfectants being used
Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas where there is a reasonable likelihood of occupational exposure
Storing food and drinks only in areas where blood or OPIM are not present
Offering Hepatitis B vaccinations to all employees with exposure to blood or OPIM
Maintaining vaccination and treatment records or declination forms in the employees’ medical file in a secure and locked location.

The benefit of using checklists was cemented with the publication of the “Keystone Initiative” findings by Pronovost in the New England Journal of Medicine. This project focused on the reduction of catheter-related bloodstream infection using a checklist to ensure adherence to infection-control practices—handwashing, using full-barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site if possible, and removing unnecessary catheters. This project garnered success by reducing and sustaining rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection that was maintained throughout the 18-month study period.125
Gawande126,127 advanced the thinking about the use of checklists in healthcare. The regimentation offered by checklists can reduce risk and save lives in complex situations. Healthcare is highly specialized. Couple complexity with specialization, the routine might be overlooked and steps skipped in processes. Consistent use and improvement of checklists may offer healthcare providers a tool to focus less of their efforts on the routine and more on the difficult.
There is resistance to the adoption of checklists in healthcare. Based on work by Treadwell, Lucas and Tsou,128 barriers to implementation can fall into these categories:
1.Confusion regarding how to properly use the checklist, efficient workflow, access to resources, and individual beliefs and attitudes.
2.Workflow problems such as extra time, duplication of safety checks already routinely performed, and access to resources required to fulfill the checklist.
3.Individual attitudes of staff toward the checklist such as resistance to changing habits and interpersonal hierarchy (e.g., operating room).
4.Legal responsibility and RM.
Healthcare quality professionals can bring knowledge about the benefits of checklists as part of the organization’s overall quality management system. Examples of sources include ISO9001:2015 and the Baldrige Excellence Framework.
See Performance and Process Improvement for more discussion on tools.
Evaluating and Improving Patient Safety
Healthcare quality professionals work collaboratively with others to improve compliance with standards set forth by TJC National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs), Leapfrog Safe Practices, NQF-endorsed measures, and federal government-vetted measures (e.g., AHRQ, National Health Safety Network). Standards for patient safety practices include recommendations to improve accuracy in patient identification, effectiveness of communication among caregivers, precautions when using high-alert medications, and surgery safeguards.129 Proposed solutions to improving patient safety range from making electronic health information readily available to providers and consumers to inviting patients to make decisions collaboratively with their care providers.28,130
When thinking about meeting or exceeding standards, part of the healthcare quality professional’s work is to identify what interventions to use and their effects—some small things can lead to big and sustainable change. There are important resources to consider, such as systems for collecting reliable and valid data, selecting measures that provide the information for evaluation, and focusing on relevant high-volume problem prone areas such as safe medication practices. As healthcare quality professionals aim to improve safety for the patient, organization, or system of care, they might consider the following for launching routine monitoring and evaluation of activities and specific projects:
•Establishing the plan to evaluate the actual impact on health outcomes, quality of care, and patient safety due to the effort (patient, healthcare personnel, clinical workflow, other relevant indicators);
•Feasibility, usability, and possibilities when identifying the target population and/or problem to be addressed;
•Clearly defining the quantifiable impact of the effort (e.g., number of incidents, rates of occurrence) and who is affected (e.g., patients, clinicians, department, unit);
•Determining appropriate tools to use (e.g., RCA, FMEA, other Lean tools); and
•Identifying mechanisms to share results and efforts resulting in improved safety (e.g., board reports, enterprise-wide communications, patient materials).
As part of developing the patient safety plan, healthcare organizations can conduct a thorough analysis of where patients and healthcare personnel are at risk for errors. In doing so, systems and processes can be hardwired. Actively engage employees in analyzing processes to ensure the organization achieves desired outcomes. Look for the differences in mindsets and close the gap by removing silos. Cross-functional objectives will promote collaboration in developing the plan.
Patient safety plans are often integrated in quality or performance improvement program plans. These are five components of an effective patient safety system:
1.monitoring of progress and maintenance of vigilance,
2.knowledge of the epidemiology of patient safety risks and hazards,
3.development of effective practices and tools,
4.building infrastructure for effective practices, and
5.achieving broader adoption of effective practices.129(p4)

Healthcare. The UCLA Health System’s Performance Improvement & Patient Safety Plan goals include the following:
•Achieve a patient safety conscious environment throughout the facility.
•Improve the reporting of medical errors by establishing a policy focusing on corrective actions through staff education for those reporting their errors, rather than punitive or disciplinary actions.
•Implement confidential electronic event reporting process that includes documentation of follow-up and reporting processes.
•Expand the implementation of evidence-based practices.
•Monitor hospital-wide indicators for established areas of focus.
•Reduce the number of medication errors.
•Monitor patient safety indicators related to an area’s specific “Scope of Service.”
•Conduct a proactive risk assessment utilizing the FMEA methodology.
•Monitor and improve areas identified through patient satisfaction surveys.131(p4)
Intermountain Healthcare’s Quality & Patient Safety Plan goals include the following:
•Attain optimal patient outcomes and patient and family experience.
•Support an engaged and safe workforce.
•Enhance appropriate utilization.
•Minimize risks and hazards of care.
•Develop and share best practices.132(p6)
When deploying the plan, various statistical process control and quality improvement tools can be used in patient safety initiatives. Statistical process control techniques and performance improvement tools are applicable to the deployment of patient safety practices throughout a healthcare enterprise. The healthcare quality professional serves an essential role in helping the organization determine if a safety issue in an organization is an infrequent event or endemic. Prioritizing functions should be utilized as part of the safety program.
See Health Data Analytics and Performance and Process Improvement for more principles, practices and tools.
Health Information
Health IT holds the promise of making healthcare services safer and offers clinical decision support through electronic health records (EHR). If health IT is to work, the healthcare consumer must be at the center of the healthcare system and be empowered with their personal healthcare data. Often these questions are asked. Is health IT easy to use? How quickly does it process information? How functional is it? How can it help me? If health IT is to be effective in the care setting, it needs to be integrated with the patient and clinical workflow and aligned with available resources and the expectations of the end users.
Leadership plays a critical role in the adoption of health IT (EHRs, personal health records, and e-prescribing systems) and ensuring risks associated with heath IT are avoided altogether or mitigated. TJC provides a framework for maintaining a culture of safety vis-à-vis health IT by
1.collective mindfulness focused on identifying, reporting, analyzing, and reducing health IT-related hazardous conditions, close calls, or errors;
2.comprehensive and systematic analysis of each adverse event causing harm to determine if health IT contributed to the event in any way; and
3.shared involvement and responsibility for the safety of health IT among the healthcare organization, clinicians, and vendors/developers.133(pp2–3)
EHRs typically include four core components: electronic clinical documentation, results reporting and management, e-prescribing, and clinical decision support. Over time, other functionalities such as barcoding and patient engagement tools were added. Health IT and interoperable systems are requisites for healthcare delivery in the 21st century. In 2012, an IOM report examined the state of the art in system safety and opportunities to build safer systems and concluded as follows:
•Safety is an emergent property of a larger system that accounts for not just the software but also how it is used by clinicians.
•The “sociotechnical system” includes technology (software, hardware), people (clinicians, patients), processes (workflow), organization (capacity, decisions about how health IT is applied, incentives), and the external environment (regulations, public opinion).
•Safer implementation and use of health IT is a complex, dynamic process that requires a shared responsibility between vendors and healthcare organizations.
•Poor user-interface design, poor workflow, and complex data interfaces threaten patient safety.
•Lack of system interoperability is a barrier to improving clinical decisions and patient safety.
•Constant, ongoing commitment to safety—from acquisition to implementation and maintenance—is needed to achieve safer, more effective care.134(ppS2-S4)
EHRs have the potential to capture data for purposes of patient safety performance and improvement. However, some say not enough evidence exists to support the link between the EHR and patient safety135 and may have unintended consequences as follows:
•Workarounds and alarm fatigue such as “delayed response time to alarms, disabled alarms, volumes set to inaudible, parameters limits set to unsafe zones, or alarms paused
p. 108
p. 109
without a thoughtful consideration of the warning message.”136(pE1)
•Incorrect patient matching where some or all data retrieved via health information exchange (HIE) relate to a different (and incorrect) patient. Such errors can happen because of flawed matching algorithms used for HIE.
•Data quality issues, such as incomplete patient data, duplicate patient records, or data entry errors, can propagate through HIE, increasing the potential for adverse safety events.
•Loss of data integrity during transmission. For example, if the HIE process alters the meaning of the data or errors in translation that occur between different systems, reflecting differences in vocabularies. If the HIE degrades EHR or other system performance, critical delays in accessing HIE data can result.137
TABLE 2-11 provides potential benefits and safety concerns of IT components commonly used in healthcare.
Table 2-11 Potential Benefits and Safety Concerns of Health Information Technology (IT) Components

As part of national efforts to improve the use of health IT, the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) was established. The NHIN is comprised of standards, services, and a trust fabric that enables the secure exchange of health information over the Internet. This critical part of the national health IT agenda is that health information follows the consumer, is available for clinical decision-making, and supports appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care to public health. A key component of the technology strategy is providing a common platform for HIE across diverse entities, within communities and across the country, helping to achieve the goals of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act.138(p4)
Free, open source software was developed to support local and national efforts to provide HIE. This kind of information exchange is critical for community-wide patient safety efforts as the NHIN will
•improve the coordination of care information among hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, pharmacies, and other providers;
p. 109
p. 110
•ensure appropriate information is available at the time and place of care;
•ensure consumer health information is secure and confidential;
•give consumers new capabilities to manage and control their personal health records, as well as providing access to their health information from EHRs and other sources;
•reduce risks from medical errors and support the delivery of appropriate, evidence-based medical care; and
•lower healthcare costs resulting from inefficiencies, medical errors, and incomplete patient information.139
An exemplar of this strategy is the implementation of a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VLER program ensures an EHR for each veteran that is accessible, with consent, by public and private sector healthcare providers. The first pilot of this program occurred in San Diego, CA, between the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Kaiser Permanente. VLER has advanced HIEs nationally and the data sharing capability was deployed in 2013.140 Another more recent example is the Delaware Health Information Network, a public–private partnership that includes all hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and laboratories in the state, 95% of its imaging centers, and 62% of the state’s pharmacies.141
Healthcare quality professionals work with others in the organization to use health IT to mitigate risks, manage care, and reduce preventable harm. As work is undertaken, consider the available tools to organize and support initiatives. For example, patient identification-related events present risk for patient care. The partnership for Health IT Patient Safety is a multi-stakeholder group working to identify how to optimize health IT for safer care. The partnership currently offers two toolkits—patient identification and cut and paste. The Health IT Safe Practices: The Safe Use of Health IT for Patient Identification toolkit offers a framework of eight safety practice recommendations using IDENTIFY—Include, Detect, Evaluate, Normalize, Tailor, Innovate, Follow-up, and Yield.142 This model is useful when looking at the independent and interacting effects of behaviors and technology. The partnership descriptions for each practice is shown in FIGURE 2-7.

into the ongoing, sustainable action plan. Gathering and using real-time data will help the organization improve and protect patients from harm. Selected measures may relate to structure, process, outcomes, resource use, or composite of measure attributes. With the proliferation of reliable and valid safety measures, the healthcare quality professional can examine available measures and determine which will be the most meaningful to the organization’s internal and external stakeholders.
There is no one single source for safety measures, so the healthcare quality professional can review available measures for the healthcare setting. The most logical place to start are measures from organizations that require certain measures for payment or accreditation. These measures may have been developed and validated by the sponsoring organization (e.g., NCQA and HEDIS) or are endorsed measures that are used by third-party payers or accreditation agencies (e.g., NQF). The following are possible sources of such measures.
The Joint Commission. TJC, through its accreditation standards and other activities, strives to help organizations achieve zero patient harm. TJC standards require the organization gather and analyze the data generated through standardized monitoring. Results are used to inform the goals and objectives of care, treatment, or services, and the outcomes of care, treatment, or services provided to the population served by aggregating and analyzing the data gathered through the standardized monitoring effort. The agency assists healthcare organizations in collecting and reporting performance improvement and accountability data through ORYX and Core Measure Sets.
The NPSGs are another way that TJC assists healthcare organizations and programs in the United States through accreditation surveys and continuous readiness. Currently, there are safety goals for ambulatory healthcare, behavioral healthcare, critical access hospitals, home care, hospitals, laboratories, nursing care centers, and office-based surgery.143 TABLE 2-12 describes examples of the current NPSGs for hospitals.
Table 2-12 Examples of the National Patient Safety Goals
Goal 1. Improve the accuracy of patient identification
Example
Use at least two patient identifiers to verify a patient’s identity upon admission or transfer to another hospital or other
care setting and prior to the administration of care.
Goal 2. Improve the effectiveness of communication among caregivers
Example
Report critical results of tests on a timely basis by defining who should receive the results; who should receive the results when the ordering provider is not available, what results require timely and reliable communication, when the results should be actively reported to the ordering provider with explicit timeframes, how to notify the responsible provider, and how to design, support, and maintain the systems involved (Hanna et al., 2005).
Goal 3. Improve the safety of using medications
Example
Maintain and communicate accurate patient medication information through medication reconciliation to avoid inadvertent inconsistencies across transitions in care by reviewing the patient’s complete medication regimen at the time of care transitions (e.g., admission, transfer, discharge) (AHRQ, 2015).
Goal 7. Reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections
Example
Comply with current hand hygiene guidelines (i.e., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] or current World Health Organization [WHO] hand hygiene guidelines).
Goal 15. The hospital identifies safety risks inherent in its patient population
Example
Use a Zero Suicide approach to identify patients at risk for suicide by screening for suicidal thoughts or behaviors at admission or intake and complete a full risk assessment when a patient screens positive.
Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, and Wrong Person Surgery
Example
A time-out is performed before the procedure that includes the confirmation of the correct patient, correct side and site, agreement on the procedure to be performed, correct patient position, availability of needed equipment/supplies/implants, and the presence and review of relevant radiologic images (if applicable) (Feldman, 2008).

The Leapfrog Group. The Leapfrog Group’s safe practices informed the development of 34 NQF-endorsed safety practices. These hospital practices, if implemented, reduce harm in several areas. The practices comprise elements related to leadership, care needs, information transfer and communication, medication management, HAIs, and specific care processes. On the 2016 Leapfrog Hospital Survey, 1,266 hospitals reported on C-sections, 987 reported mortality rates for surgeries, and 1,702 reported their Never Events policy.144
National Quality Forum. As a leader in patient safety, NQF is recognized as a voluntary consensus standards-setting organization as defined by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. Since 2002, NQF assembled a portfolio of more than 600 NQF-endorsed measures in use by both the private and public sectors for public reporting and quality improvement. Most notably, NQF accomplished the following:
•2003: Endorsed a set of 30 practices for universal use in applicable clinical care settings to reduce the risk of harm to consumers.
•2006: Undertook an update of the original set and endorsed practices with significantly expanded specifications, supporting literature, and guidance for implementation.
•2009: Endorsed practices were updated to address pediatric imaging, organ donation, caring for caregivers, glycemic control, and falls prevention.
•2010: Added evidence to the existing practices, and more direction was given to healthcare professionals for implementation and patient and family engagement.157
NQF has endorsed over 100 consensus standards with a focus on patient safety.79 The NQF’s consensus-setting efforts support the evaluation of patient safety using standardized performance measurement. The NQF also maintains the Quality Positioning System (QPS), which helps to select measures that might align with monitoring, reporting, and improvement interests.145 TABLE 2-13 presents the NQF Patient Safety Portfolio of Measures representing structure, process and outcomes.

Evaluating the Culture of Safety
How does an organization evaluate its progress and success in achieving a culture of safety? Safety culture is generally measured by patients and healthcare providers. Safety culture measures reflect teamwork training, executive walk rounds, and establishing unit-based safety teams. These have been associated with improvements in safety culture measures but have not yet linked to lower error rates. Other methods, such as “rapid response teams and structured communication methods such as SBAR, are being widely implemented to help address cultural issues such as rigid hierarchies and communication problems, but their effect on overall safety culture and error rates remains.”146 SBAR is an acronym for
p. 113
p. 114
Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation, which is a standardized tool used in healthcare settings to facilitate communication.
Surveys are the most common approach to evaluating the safety climate or safety culture. For the purposes of reporting on NQF Safe Practice 2: Culture Measurement, Feedback, and Intervention, hospitals must conduct a culture of safety survey of their employees within the past 24 months. The units surveyed must account for at least 50% of the aggregated care delivered to patients within the facility, and includes the high patient safety risk units or departments using a nationally recognized tool that has demonstrated validity, consistency, and reliability. When selecting a survey tool for the organization, the healthcare quality professional should consider the following:
•Alignment of survey with setting where survey will be administered.
•Nationally recognized survey that is determined valid and reliable.
•Survey supported by evidence from peer-reviewed literature.
•Respondent burden is minimized.
•Results offer information that is actionable.
•Benchmarking data are available.147–149
Validated surveys will have well-detailed methodology to assure a successful survey administration. Healthcare quality professionals should consider using a third-party vendor for the survey administration—the vendor can be a safe intermediary for data collection, ensure anonymity of respondents, and work with the organization to achieve higher response rates. Descriptions of more commonly used assessment and survey tools follow.
The Oro 2.0 High Reliability Organizational Assessment. TJC Center for Transforming Health Care Oro 2.0 High Reliability Organizational Assessment consists of a series of questions for senior leaders to reflect upon and come to consensus on the organization’s current high-reliability status. The Assessment looks at the organization’s level of maturity and incorporates multiple domains across 14 areas of performance such as leadership commitment to achieving zero patient harm, how the safety culture is functioning, and the deployment of performance improvement tools. Per the Center, the Oro 2.0 accomplishes the following:
•Serves as a guiding force for transformation.
•Provides crucial information about strengths, opportunities, and potential investment strategies for achieving high performance.
•Can be repeated to assess the organization’s progress in its high-reliability journey over time.150
All staff at accredited hospitals and critical access hospitals can access ORO 2.0 through the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare’s website, or can be granted access through Joint Commission Connect.
Physician Practice Patient Safety Assessment. When the IOM published Crossing the Quality Chasm in 2001, the extent of preventable medical errors was far reaching.21 Many initiatives focus on inpatient care and fewer focus on other settings such as ambulatory or nursing home care. The Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET)—in partnership with the AHA, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), and the Medical Group Management Association and its certifying body, the American College of Medical Practice Executives—developed the Physician Practice Patient Safety Assessment (PPPSA) for the medical practice setting.151 The PPPSA is an interactive self-assessment tool for evaluating medication safety, handoffs and transitions, surgery and invasive procedures, personnel qualifications and competency, practice management and culture, and patient education and communication. Healthcare quality professionals in ambulatory settings can use the PPPSA to
•gain specific ideas to improve patient safety,
•compare data to aggregate results for similar practices,
•enhance team’s awareness of patient safety issues,
•heighten provider awareness of characteristics that make a practice safer,
•create a new reference point and baseline to enhance and support patient safety, and
•document successes and track progress.152
University of Texas Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. This Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) measures caregiver attitudes about six patient safety-related domains, allows organizations to compare themselves to others, prompt interventions to improve safety attitudes, and measure the effectiveness of these interventions. The SAQ domain scales are teamwork climate, job satisfaction, perceptions of management, safety climate, working conditions, and stress recognition.148,153 An organization can use the tool to gather baseline data and measure the effectiveness of change and the adoption of patient safety practices.
Patient Safety Climate in Healthcare Organizations. The Patient Safety Climate in Healthcare Organizations survey is designed to assess the healthcare workforce’s perception about the culture of safety in their organization. It assesses different aspects of safety including contributions to safety climate from the hospital, work unit, interpersonal and other. Contributing factors are measured including engagement, resources, emphasis on patient safety, unit support,
p. 114
p. 115
unit-level factors (e.g., safety norms, recognition, support, and collective learning). The fear of shame and fear of blame and punishment subscales are considered interpersonal contributions to safety climate. The provision of safe care is also examined.149,154
AHRQ Surveys on Patient Safety Culture. As part of its goal to support a culture of patient safety and quality improvement in the nation’s healthcare system, AHRQ developed its patient safety culture assessment tools for healthcare. In 2004, AHRQ developed and distributed a valid and reliable safety culture survey, the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture,155 to help hospitals, nursing homes, and ambulatory outpatient medical offices evaluate the culture of safety in their institutions. In 2008, AHRQ released its first benchmarking report based upon an analysis of data from 400 voluntary participating hospitals. Healthcare organizations can use these surveys to track changes in patient safety over time and evaluate the effects of patient safety interventions.34
The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture: 2016 User Comparative Database Report is a compilation of the most recent survey findings. Based on data provided voluntarily by hospitals, the report provides results hospitals can use as benchmarks to establish a culture of safety in comparison to similar hospitals or hospital units. The survey evaluates patient safety issues, medical errors, and event reporting. It includes 42 items that measure 12 areas, or composites, of patient safety culture. Each of the 12 composites or areas and their definitions are described in TABLE 2-14.
Table 2-14 Patient Safety Culture Composites and Definitions

In 2016, 680 hospitals submitted survey data, representing 447,584 staff respondents representing medicine, surgery, and other areas. The results reflected progress in teamwork, management expectations around promoting patient safety, and organizational learning. However, continued potential for improvement in most hospitals was found for patient safety practices, particularly nonpunitive response to reporting, hand offs and transitions, and workload. Areas of strength are shown in TABLE 2-15 and issues presenting the most potential for improvement are shown in Table 2-8.

Validated provider surveys from AHRQ’s portfolio of Patient Safety Culture Surveys survey instruments include the following:
•Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture
•Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture
•Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture
•Community Pharmacy Survey on Patient Safety Culture
•Ambulatory Surgery Center Survey on Patient Safety Culture.
These surveys ask providers to rate the safety culture in their unit and the whole organization. Annual benchmarking data are available in AHRQ’s comprehensive reports.
Monitoring Safe Medication Practices
Even though many treatment procedures involve some risk, by far the most common errors occur with the use of medications. The frequency of medication use in the United States is startling. More than four out of five U.S. adults take at least one medication (prescription or over-the-counter drug, vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement), and almost one-third take at least five different medications. Further, it is estimated the extra medical costs of treating medication-related injuries amounts to $3.5 billion per year.156 In healthcare facilities, most errors occur in the prescribing and administration stages of medication therapy. Further, it is estimated that it costs the US $289 billion per year for medication non-adherence.157
The patient safety culture has its foundation an atmosphere devoid of blame. An organization uses systematic ways to welcome the reporting of medication errors. Because 85% of errors are the result of system failures and traditionally only 15% are due to human error, the exploration of systems issues is primary to identifying a root cause of error.88 Both public and private sector organizations that have worked tirelessly to reduce medication errors include the ISMP, ECRI Institute, and the FDA.
Through a consensus process, NQF endorsed the adoption of safe practices related to medication administration (TABLE 2-16). Other organizations such as the Leapfrog Group have shown support by their endorsements. To improve patient safety and hold the gains, healthcare organizations conduct a thorough analysis of where and how patients are at risk for potential medical errors and hardwire systems and processes to prevent them. Leadership style and climate have also been found to affect medication practices so the routine administration of culture of safety surveys may prove beneficial to identify opportunities for improvement at the organization and unit levels.158

Incorporate within the organization a safe, effective communication strategy, structures, and systems to include the following:
•For verbal or telephone orders or for telephonic reporting of critical test results, verify the complete order or test result by having the person who is receiving the information record and “read back” the complete order or test result.
•Standardize a list of “Do Not Use” abbreviations, acronyms, symbols, and dose designations that cannot be used throughout the organization.
Safe Practice 16: Safe Adoption of Computerized Prescriber Order Entry
•Implement a computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE) system built upon the requisite foundation of reengineered evidence-based care, an assurance of healthcare organization staff and independent practitioner readiness, and an integrated information technology infrastructure.
Safe Practice 17: Medication Reconciliation
•The healthcare organization must develop, reconcile, and communicate an accurate medication list throughout the continuum of care.
Safe Practice 18: Pharmacist Leadership Structures and Systems
•Pharmacy leaders should have an active role on the administrative leadership team that reflects their authority and accountability for medication management systems performance across the organization.

Technology Solutions
Various technological solutions are proposed to enhance patient safety programs. A patient safety solution is defined as “any system design or intervention that has demonstrated
p. 116
p. 117
the ability to prevent or mitigate patient harm stemming from the processes of health care.”159(p2) The premise of these solutions is that if processes are standardized and the potential for medical error is reduced by the automation of processes, errors will be mitigated. Clancy33 proposed a formula for healthcare improvement comprised of four health IT elements: (1) connect health records, (2) build smart systems, (3) put the patient at the center of care, and (4) put prevention at the center of treatment. This is illustrated in TABLE 2-17.

Patient Safety and the Learning Organization
It is imperative that a continuous, dynamic learning healthcare system is achieved. This system is one that “provides the best care at lower cost: (1) managing rapidly increasing complexity; (2) achieving greater value in health care; and (3) capturing opportunities from technology, industry, and policy.”160(p8) How can this be achieved by a learning organization? The infrastructure of a learning organization embraces lifelong learning as a value and opportunities are continually provided for capacity building, developing core competencies, and seeking patient safety innovations. This includes cultivating good judgment and having the opportunity to use it. A learning organization embraces team learning, shared vision and goals, shared ways of thinking, individual commitment to lifelong learning, and systems thinking.161 Greater attention is paid to learning that fosters more rapid progress in patient safety, increases organizational capabilities, strengthens a culture of safety, fixes process problems that contribute to patient harm, and produces higher reliability.162
Creating the infrastructure for learning can be accomplished in many ways. As summarized by the ISMP,163 these are suggested steps for creating an infrastructure for learning that were informed by Conway’s work (2008). These include the following:
•Identifying reliable sources of information about errors and risks
•Establishing a systematic way to review external information about errors and risk
•Bringing outside points of view into an organization from the literature or experts
•Leveraging the learning of other organizations that had high-profile errors (e.g., contributing factors, how the error was addressed)
•Integrating learning into existing processes in the organization (e.g., safety committee, board reports, unit-level quality teams).
The healthcare quality professional can work with others in the organization to build a sustainable infrastructure that includes a multifaceted learning and organizational development plan for patient safety that is appropriate for the healthcare setting and is reflective of the development needs of personnel. The plan should be competency-based where individual and team clinical and interpersonal skill development will result in performance excellence for safety processes and outcomes. The plan can be supported by evidence-based publications and materials available from
p. 117
p. 118
national and international organizations who already have developed curricula for teaching patient safety.
In 2017, IHI and Safe & Reliable Healthcare released their white paper that talked about the importance of continuous reflection to assess performance. Learning systems that support reflection work to “identify defects and act on them; they reward proactivity rather than reactivity. Learning and a healthy culture reinforce one another by identifying and resolving clinical, cultural, and operational defects. By effectively applying improvement science, organizations can learn their way into many of the cultural components of the framework.”164 The intersections between culture and learning in this framework are shown in FIGURE 2-8.

Some examples to use in building infrastructure are shown alphabetically below and is by no means exhaustive. These resources are evidence-based and include validated tools for improving safety practices. All organizations offer professional development and learning programs, some with nominal or no charge to the user.
Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research
AHRQ offers a portfolio of free curriculum tools and toolkits for all healthcare settings.165 AHRQ tools are practical and research-based. Healthcare professionals in all settings can use these tools to make care safer and improve their communication and teamwork skills. Examples of these tools are provided here:
•Diabetes Planned Visit Notebook
•Advancing Pharmacy Health Literacy Practices Through Quality Improvement
p. 118
p. 119
•Staying Healthy Through Education and Prevention (STEP)
•Chronic Care Model
•Central Line-associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) Tools
•Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) Toolkit
•SHARE Approach.
One of the more widely used programs, Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) is a teamwork system developed by AHRQ and the Department of Defense. It is based on team structure and four teachable-learnable skills: communication, leadership, situation monitoring, and mutual support. FIGURE 2-9 shows the framework where there is
Figure 2-9 TeamSTEPPS 2.0 framework and competencies. (From Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Pocket Guide: TeamSTEPPS team strategies & tools to enhance performance and patient safety; 2013. https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/professionals/education/curriculum-tools/teamstepps/instructor/essentials/pocketguide.pdf. Accessed April 17, 2017.)
a two-way dynamic interplay between the four skills and the team-related outcomes. Interaction between the outcomes and skills is the basis of a team striving to deliver safe, quality care and support quality improvement. Encircling the four skills is the team structure of the patient care team, which represents not only the patient and direct caregivers, but also those who play a supportive role within the health care delivery system.166(p4)
TeamSTEPPS 2.0 serves as the core curriculum for training. It is scientifically rooted in more than 20 years of research and lessons from the application of teamwork principles and system error prevention.167(¶2) Using tools such as SBAR, huddles and Two-Challenge Rule, TeamSTEPPS intends to produce outcomes such as mutual trust, adaptability and shared mentality. TeamSTEPPS provides higher quality, safer patient care by increasing team awareness and clarifying team roles and responsibilities.(167¶3)
ECRI Institute
This nonprofit organization is dedicated to bringing applied scientific research to improving patient care using the best medical procedures, devices, drugs, and processes. Resources are offered by clinical specialty, care setting, and role. This member service organization’s clients include hospitals, health systems, public and private payers, U.S. federal and state government agencies, health clinics, patients, policymakers, ministries of health, associations, and accrediting agencies worldwide. In 2014, ECRI convened the Partnership for Health IT Patient Safety, which develops and publicly disseminates resources and educational tools that help identify and remediate harm associated with health IT. Another valuable patient safety resource for is the ECRI’s Medical Device Safety Reports (MDSR) database. The MDSR is a repository of medical device incident and hazard information independently investigated by ECRI. It offers updated reviews of the types of problems occurring with medical devices and lessons learned over the past three decades.

The ISMP initiatives include ISMP Medication Safety Alert! newsletters for healthcare professionals, frequent educational programs, and teleconferences on current medication use issues. The organization develops posters, videos, patient brochures, books and other resources and has valuable medication safety tools such as lists of high-alert drugs and potentially dangerous abbreviations. ISMP is a PSO and provides confidential consulting services to healthcare systems to proactively evaluate medication systems or analyze medication-related sentinel events.169
The Joint Commission
TJC accredits organizations across the continuum of care and leverages decades of knowledge and experience to develop and share literature from industry experts and safety scholars from other industries (e.g., nuclear power, air transportation). In addition to developing standards of care, TJC offers conceptual and practical frameworks for patient safety programs, methods, and practices (e.g., safety culture, high reliability, RCA, sentinel events).
In 2008, the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare was formed to pursue solutions to healthcare’s most critical safety and quality problems. Useful resources specific to patient safety are described below:
•Patient Safety Systems. This chapter from the 2017 Comprehensive Accreditation Manual for Hospitals is intended to help inform and educate hospitals about the importance and structure of an integrated patient safety system. Although the information is drawn from hospital patient safety, there is general discussion of leadership, patient safety culture, effective use of data, and proactive risk assessment to prevent harm.170
•Oro 2.0 Resource Library. Provides more than 125 references and tools to help organizations learn about the 14 component areas of performance within the High Reliability Maturity Model.
National Association for Healthcare Quality
The National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ) was founded in 1976 and is solely dedicated to the healthcare quality profession. It is the primary source for healthcare quality education for the healthcare quality professional and has defined the body of knowledge and essential competencies for the healthcare quality professional. Professional development opportunities that relate to patient safety are described below.
HQ Principles. HQ Principles171 is an interactive online certificate program that introduces quality and patient safety fundamentals, methodologies, and concepts for healthcare professionals. The certificate validates knowledge and demonstrates value. Those who can benefit from this program include individuals new to healthcare quality, individuals who have been given added responsibilities or who are looking to refresh their knowledge, and healthcare leaders with teams that need foundational healthcare quality learning opportunities.
HQ Essentials. HQ Essentials172 defines six areas of competence and applies to all healthcare settings across the continuum of care. The six areas are performance improvement and process improvement; population health and care transitions; health data analytics; patient safety; regulatory and accreditation; and quality review and accountability. HQ Essentials for patient safety outlines the competency dimensions for safety, which include (1) foster a culture of safety, (2) adopt methods to identify and evaluate risk for harm, and (3) managing and mitigating risk for harm. Within each dimension, descriptors are provided for advances and master proficiency levels. As example, FIGURE 2-10 shows the dimension for mitigating and managing risk for harm. When used as an individual or organizational assessment and development tool, it can provide valuable information to gauge strengths and opportunities and identify where resources can be allocated to support learning, competency development, and capacity building.

See WHO facts related to patient safety in TABLE 2-18.
Table 2-18 Ten Facts on Patient Safety
1.Patient safety is a serious global public health issue. There is now growing recognition that patient safety and quality is a critical dimension of universal health coverage. Since the launch of the WHO Patient Safety Programme in 2004, over 140 countries have worked to address the challenges of unsafe care.
2.One in 10 patients may be harmed while in the hospital. Estimates show that in developed countries as many as one in 10 patients is harmed while receiving hospital care. The harm can be caused by a range of errors or adverse events.
3.Hospital infections affect 14 out of every 100 patients admitted. Of every 100 hospitalized patients at any given time, 7 in developed and 10 in developing countries will acquire healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Hundreds of millions of patients are affected worldwide each year. Simple and low-cost infection prevention and control measures, such as appropriate hand hygiene, can reduce the frequency of HAIs by more than 50%.
4.Most people lack access to appropriate medical devices. There are an estimated 1.5 million different medical devices and over 10,000 types of devices available worldwide. The majority of the world’s population is denied adequate access to safe and appropriate medical devices within their health systems. More than half of low- and lower middle-income countries do not have a national health technology policy which could ensure the effective use of resources through proper planning, assessment, acquisition and management of medical devices.
5.Unsafe injections decreased by 88% from 2000 to 2010. Key injection safety indicators measured in 2010 show that important progress has been made in the reuse rate of injection devices (5.5% in 2010), while modest gains were made through the reduction of the number of injections per person per year (2.88 in 2010).
6.Delivery of safe surgery requires a teamwork approach. An estimated 234 million surgical operations are performed globally every year. Surgical care is associated with a considerable risk of complications. Surgical care errors contribute to a significant burden of disease despite the fact that 50% of complications associated with surgical care are avoidable.
7.About 20–40% of all health spending is wasted due to poor quality care. Safety studies show that additional hospitalization, litigation costs, infections acquired in hospitals, disability, lost productivity and medical expenses cost some countries as much as US$19 billion annually. The economic benefits of improving patient safety are therefore compelling.
8.A poor safety record for healthcare. Industries with a perceived higher risk such as the aviation and nuclear industries have a much better safety record than healthcare. There is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a traveler being harmed while in an aircraft. In comparison, there is a 1 in 300 chance of a patient being harmed during healthcare.
9.Patient and community engagement and empowerment are key. People’s experience and perspectives are valuable resources for identifying needs, measuring progress and evaluating outcomes.
10.Hospital partnerships can play a critical role. Hospital-to-hospital partnerships to improving patient safety and quality of care have been used for technical exchange between health workers for a number of decades. These partnerships provide a channel for bi-directional patient safety learning and the co-development of solutions in rapidly evolving global health systems.

Section Summary
Healthcare professionals work diligently to identify and act on opportunities to improve safety. Attention is given to planning, development, implementation, and evaluation, as well as to continuous improvement. In summary, the following tenets are imperative for an effective patient safety program in any healthcare organization:
•Healthcare leaders set the vision, mission, purpose, intention, and direction and provide the resources necessary to adopt evidence-based patient safety practices.
•Error prevention and harm reduction are the shared responsibility of the board, executive leaders, medical leaders, healthcare personnel, and the patient and family. At every intersection, there is an opportunity to take different actions to mitigate risks and reduce harm.
•Organizations create and maintain a fair and just culture by being mindful, taking actions to reduce preventable errors and mitigate risks, and emphasizing learning to support the workforce in eliminating or preventing future errors.
•Patient empowerment and engagement in patient safety will lead to better outcomes and fewer errors.
•Safety program development, implementation, and evaluation considerations include
⚬identifying needs and priorities at the organization, department, unit, team, and individual levels;
⚬determining how technology can support the program;
⚬integrating efforts with RM and infection prevention;
⚬monitoring and analyzing close calls, near-misses, and errors;
⚬supporting ethical practices in patient safety using fair and just culture principles; and
•identifying strategies for adoption, spread, and evaluation of evidence-based safety interventions and innovations.
Patient safety gets better through learning and doing using advanced technology, teamwork, and communication approaches that have been proven to mitigate errors, reduce harm and save lives. Healthcare quality professionals can lead and collaborate on these efforts. They possess the unique experience and expertise to advance safety practices in their organizations and the community-at-large. This can be accomplished by bringing knowledge, promising practices, improvement tools, and safety innovations to the healthcare setting.
