The Triple Aim was the brainchild of two of our faculty John Whittington and Tom Nolan who came up with in about 2006 I remember them coming in with the idea and it was a real breakthrough so the goal they had in mind was to articulate in a very efficient way the aims of healthcare up until that time the answer would have been probably the best answer would have been referenced to the Institute of Medicine report crossing the quality chasm which had laid out six dimensions of quali six dimensions of need they call them aims for improvement and those most people in the field now know them their safety effectiveness patient-centeredness timeliness efficiency and equity everyone up until that point was oh well that's well that's what the social need is six aims and Whittington and no one said not wait a minute that's about if you need the care so if you need the care absolutely it's those those properties should be there and you're when you care for your heart attack your broken arm your depression or you get your checkup in the experi the individual experience of care but they said there's actually a second component of aim and they call that the health of the population because why do you have your heart attack why why did you break your arm why why are you depressed and the causes they don't lie in healthcare the cause of illness isn't the absence of health care health care is a repair shop so they said that society also needs us to keep you help you stay what healthy and the third aim they added which I think was particularly brilliant is while reducing per capita cost and that is because the the needs of the society that the people we serve go beyond healthcare they've got other things to do with the resources they may want to go to the movies tonight or you know a corporation maybe you want to be more competitive and pay its workers more and government may need to put money into roads or schools so they posited this collection is the system of aims better care for individuals that are health for populations and lower per capita cost as the as is a complete statement as they possibly could of the social need we're here to fill it's like a compass direction that tells us what success is and that became known as the the Triple Aim
